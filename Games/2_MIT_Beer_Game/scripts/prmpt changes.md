 Below are targeted issues I spotted in the logs and concrete fixes to make the pipeline both **more stable** and **more logically correct**.

---

## A) Logical / Modeling Issues

1. **Conflicting economics across phases**

* *Comms phase:* holding = **\$0.5**, backlog = **\$1.5**, profit = **\$2.5**/unit
* *Decision phase:* holding = **\$0.1**, backlog = **\$1.5**, profit = **\$5.0**/unit
  → Agents are optimizing against inconsistent objectives.
  **Fix:** Define a single source of truth for unit economics (including **purchase cost c** and **selling price p**) and reuse verbatim in *all* prompts. State per‑round profit formula explicitly:

```
profit_t = p*units_sold_t - c*order_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
```

for this please make sure to import these params from the exectue mit beergame scirpt params when i run the script and do not define the prams size and number here in the promot script.

2. **Ambiguous / contradictory control rules**

* You tell agents “**Never let inventory go to zero**” *and* “you may order 0 to reduce inventory”, while several states start with zero inventory.
  **Fix:** Replace with a target-safety‑stock policy: “Aim for safety stock S\_s (not strictly >0). It’s acceptable to be at zero if demand is met and backlog is low.”

3. **Shipment constraint wording is inconsistent**

* “You can only ship **equal to** (their\_order + your\_backlog)” vs elsewhere “up to”.
  **Fix:** Clarify that shipment quantity is determined by the algorithm after the prompt: the system will attempt to ship (order + backlog), but if inventory is insufficient, it will ship all available inventory instead. The prompt should not ask the agent to decide shipment; this is handled automatically by the simulation logic.

4. **Retailer ordering ignores backlog despite instruction**

* Retailer backlog = **54**, expected demand \~**10–12**, lead time **1**, incoming shipment **2**. The Retailer ordered **10**, which can’t even cover expected demand, let alone backlog.
  **Fix:** Provide a **mandatory formula** that *must* be used (see Section C), and add a self‑check to block orders that don’t cover at least expected demand when inventory=0.

5. **Communication influencing decisions when “communication is disabled”**

* Decision prompts say “Communication is disabled”, yet you pass “Recent Communications” and the agents rely on them.
  **Fix:** Either (a) remove communications from the decision prompts, or (b) allow it and stop saying it’s disabled. Don’t mix.

6. **Timing / bookkeeping inconsistencies**

* “Orders received per agent: \[12, 0, 2, 2]” conflicts with each stage ordering **10** in the decision phase; round indexing shows “Retailer (Round 0)” although it’s Round 9/10.
* “Total LLM calls 124, tokens 0, cost \$0” is not credible.
  **Fix:** Align event order (orders → production → shipments → sales → costs), fix round indexing, and compute metrics from logs rather than placeholders.


8. **“Stabilize at 10” consensus is harmful to the Retailer**

* With a 54 backlog and L=1, a flat **10** keeps the Retailer starved.
  **Fix:** Role‑specific objectives must dominate consensus: Retailer should prioritize backlog clearance rate; upstream should cover that—consensus targets are secondary. this is also a new param in the execution sciprt if consnesu is mor eimprotant then selfshiness is that param about and its called --longtermplanning_boolean

## B) Prompt / UX Changes That Increase Stability


**3) Enforce a short self‑audit checklist in the decision prompt**
Before emitting JSON, the agent must internally confirm:

* “Am I solvent after ordering (Balance − c\*order ≥ 0)?”
  If any answer is “no”, the agent must adjust and re‑compute.

**4) Keep communications factual & role‑bounded**

* Limit to: inventory, backlog, recent mean demand, order just placed, and planned backlog‑clearance rate γ.
* Prohibit emotionally charged language (“collapse”), and prohibit prescribing other roles’ quantities; they may request ranges.


**7) Make costs consistent and visible**

* Add `{selling_price p, unit_cost c, holding h, backlog b}` in every state block.
* Include the **per‑round cash forecast** table in the sim (pre‑ and post‑order).

## E) Concrete prompt edits (drop‑in)

**Replace the conflicting rules with:**

> *Lead time is 1 round. You may ship **at most** (downstream\_order + your\_backlog). Costs are p, c, h, b per unit as listed below and identical in all phases. Your per‑round profit is `p*sales - c*orders - h*inventory_end - b*backlog_end`. Target a safety stock S\_s rather than “never zero.” You must compute and use the controller below and include the “calc” object in your JSON.*

**Insert the controller block and checklist (short):**

> *Compute μ, σ (EWMA), IP, S*, BacklogClear=γ*Backlog.
> Provisional order O\_raw = max(0, S* - IP + BacklogClear).
> Smooth to band ±δ around μ, then apply solvency cap.
> Self‑audit: cover expected demand if OnHand=0; include backlog; solvency true. If any fail, adjust and recompute.\*

**In communication prompts:**

> *Allowed fields: inventory, backlog, μ, next order, γ, risks. Disallowed: prescribing exact quantities to others; emotive language; contradictions with your role’s controller.*

---

## F) Logging / analysis fixes

* Align round indices (don’t label “Round 0” during Round 9/10). there must be a imstake somewhere.
* Log **orders placed**, **orders received**, **shipments sent/received**, **sales**, **ending I & B**, **cost breakdown**, in that exact event order.
