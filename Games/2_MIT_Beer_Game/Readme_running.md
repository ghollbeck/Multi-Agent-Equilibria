# MIT Beer Game - Comprehensive Development Log & Documentation

## üìö WHAT IS THE MIT BEER GAME?

### **Educational Background**
The MIT Beer Game is a classic **supply chain management simulation** developed at the MIT Sloan School of Management in the 1960s by Jay Forrester and others. It demonstrates the **Bullwhip Effect** - how small changes in consumer demand can cause increasingly large swings in orders upstream in the supply chain.

### **Educational Objectives**
- **Bullwhip Effect**: Understanding how demand amplification occurs in supply chains
- **Information Asymmetry**: How lack of communication causes suboptimal decisions
- **Lead Time Impact**: Understanding delays and their effect on ordering behavior
- **Coordination Challenges**: Why local optimization often leads to global suboptimization
- **Cost Management**: Balancing holding costs, backlog costs, and service levels

### **Traditional Game Setup**
- **4 Roles**: Retailer ‚Üí Wholesaler ‚Üí Distributor ‚Üí Factory
- **Information Constraints**: Each player only sees orders from downstream (not end customer demand)
- **Lead Times**: 1-2 rounds between ordering and receiving inventory
- **Cost Structure**: Holding costs for excess inventory, backlog costs for unfilled orders
- **Goal**: Minimize individual total cost (holding + backlog costs)

### **Common Outcomes in Traditional Game**
- **Demand Amplification**: Small customer demand changes create huge upstream swings
- **Bullwhip Pattern**: Orders oscillate wildly as players over-correct
- **High Costs**: Poor coordination leads to either excess inventory or stockouts
- **Learning Effect**: Subsequent rounds often show improvement with better communication

## ü§ñ LLM-ENHANCED MIT BEER GAME

### **Our Innovation: AI-Powered Agents**
This simulation replaces human players with **Large Language Model (LLM) agents** that:
- **Learn and Adapt**: Develop and update ordering strategies based on performance
- **Communicate**: Exchange information and coordinate (when enabled)
- **Remember**: Utilize memory systems to learn from past experiences
- **Optimize**: Maximize individual profit while considering supply chain dynamics

### **Key Simulation Features**
- **Role-Specific Prompts**: Each agent (Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor, Factory) receives tailored context
- **Realistic Constraints**: Shipment constraints prevent unrealistic oversupplying
- **Economic Modeling**: Holding costs ($0.50/unit/round), backlog costs ($1.50/unit/round), profits ($5.00/unit sold)
- **Dynamic Strategy**: Agents can update strategies between generations
- **Communication System**: Agents can coordinate via structured messaging
- **Memory Integration**: Past experiences inform future decisions
- **Full State Access**: Agents have complete access to their current balance, inventory, and backlog during both communication and decision phases

### **Supply Chain Flow**
```
External Demand ‚Üí [Retailer] ‚Üí [Wholesaler] ‚Üí [Distributor] ‚Üí [Factory] ‚Üí Production
                      ‚Üë           ‚Üë            ‚Üë           ‚Üë
                   Orders      Orders       Orders      Orders
                      ‚Üì           ‚Üì            ‚Üì           ‚Üì
                  Shipments   Shipments   Shipments   Shipments
```

### **Agent Information Access During Communication**
**CONFIRMED**: Agents have **full access** to their current state information during communication rounds, including:

- ‚úÖ **Current Inventory**: Exact inventory level (units)
- ‚úÖ **Current Backlog**: Unfilled orders requiring fulfillment  
- ‚úÖ **Total Profit/Balance**: Complete financial status (${profit_accumulated:.2f})
- ‚úÖ **Recent Orders**: History of downstream demand/orders
- ‚úÖ **Last Order Placed**: Most recent ordering decision
- ‚úÖ **Current Strategy**: Strategic approach being followed
- ‚úÖ **Communication History**: Previous messages from other agents

**Implementation Location**: `models_mitb_game.py` - `generate_communication_message()` method
**Prompt Structure**: Same comprehensive state information provided during decision-making phases

This ensures agents can make **informed communications** about their situation and propose **realistic coordination strategies** based on their actual financial and inventory status.

### **Agent Decision Process**
1. **Observe State**: Inventory, backlog, recent orders, incoming shipments
2. **Communicate**: Exchange information with other agents (if enabled)
3. **Decide Order**: Use LLM reasoning to determine optimal order quantity
4. **Execute**: Place orders and fulfill downstream demand
5. **Learn**: Update strategies based on performance and outcomes

- **AFTER**: **CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT**: Agents can only ship up to `(downstream_order + current_backlog)` units

**New Constraint Logic:**
```python
# For each agent in supply chain
max_allowed_shipment = downstream_order + agent.backlog
available_to_ship = min(agent.inventory, max_allowed_shipment)

# Apply constraint with logging
if logger and agent.inventory > max_allowed_shipment:
    logger.log(f"üì¶ [{agent.role_name}] Shipment constraint applied: inventory={agent.inventory}, max_allowed={max_allowed_shipment}")
```

**Constraint Applied To:**

## üìä Latest Changes & Implementation Log

### üéØ Implementation 8: Order Received Tracking (Latest)
**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Summary**: Added explicit tracking of new orders received from downstream customers each round

**Changes Made**:
1. **Enhanced RoundData Structure** (`models_mitb_game.py`):
   - Added `order_received: int` parameter to track new orders from downstream customers
   - Now logs both what agents ordered upstream AND what they received from downstream

2. **Order Flow Tracking** (`MIT_Beer_Game.py`):
   - Added `orders_received_from_downstream` array to track new customer orders
   - Retailer: tracks `retailer_demand` (external customer demand)
   - Wholesaler: tracks `retailer_order` (orders from Retailer)
   - Distributor: tracks `wh_order` (orders from Wholesaler)
   - Factory: tracks `dist_order` (orders from Distributor)

3. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Human-readable logs now show "Orders received per agent" alongside shipments
   - CSV/JSON exports include the new `order_received` field
   - Logger output includes order tracking for debugging

**Business Value**: 
- Agents can now see exactly what new demand pressure came in each round
- Better understanding of order flow vs shipment flow
- Clearer visibility into supply chain demand propagation
- Enhanced analysis of bullwhip effect patterns

**Key Distinction**:
- `order_received` = New orders from downstream customers (demand to fulfill)
- `shipment_received` = Goods received from upstream suppliers (inventory replenishment)
- `order_placed` = Orders sent to upstream suppliers
- `shipment_sent_downstream` = Goods shipped to downstream customers

### üéØ Implementation 7: Enhanced Communication & Profit Optimization
**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Summary**: Enhanced communication prompts for profit-focused collaboration and updated default profit values

**Changes Made**:
1. **Enhanced Communication Prompts** (`prompts_mitb_game.py`):
   - Added "CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES" section emphasizing:
     - üìä PROFIT FOCUS: Share current profit status and threats
     - üì¶ INVENTORY STATUS: Transparently share inventory/backlog situation
     - ü§ù COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose total supply chain profit maximization
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about market instability risks
   - Added "CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT" section with:
     - Lead time information (1 round for all orders)
     - Economics (holding $0.5, backlog $1.5, profit $2.5 per unit)
     - Shipment constraints and factory production details
   - Enhanced elaboration requirements for timing, costs, and stability

2. **Updated Default Profit Values**:
   - Changed profit_per_unit_sold from $5.00 to $2.50 throughout:
     - `prompts_mitb_game.py`: All prompt methods
     - `models_mitb_game.py`: All agent methods
     - `MIT_Beer_Game.py`: Simulation functions and hyperparameters
     - `executeMITBeerGame.py`: Command line default
   - Makes profit margins tighter, encouraging better coordination

**Communication Enhancement Example**:
```python
# Before: Generic sharing suggestions
"Consider sharing: demand patterns, coordination suggestions..."

# After: Specific profit-focused objectives
"CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
üìä PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($X) and how decisions affect it
üì¶ INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (X units) and backlog (Y units)
ü§ù COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
‚ö†Ô∏è PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability"
```

**Research Impact**:
- Agents now explicitly discuss profit trajectories and threats
- Enhanced awareness of supply chain timing (1-round lead time)
- Tighter profit margins ($2.50 vs $5.00) create more challenging optimization
- Communication focuses on preventing total market collapse
- Better alignment between individual and collective profit goals

### üéØ Implementation 6: Configurable Initial Agent Values
**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Summary**: Made agent starting conditions configurable via command line

**Changes Made**:
1. **Modified BeerGameAgent class** (`models_mitb_game.py`):
   - Changed `shipments_in_transit` default from `{0:10, 1:10}` to `{0:0, 1:0}` 
   - Added `create_agent()` class method for configurable initialization
   - Agents now start with zero shipments in transit for clean initial state

2. **Enhanced executeMITBeerGame.py**:
   - Added `--initial_inventory` parameter (default: 100)
   - Added `--initial_backlog` parameter (default: 0)
   - Parameters passed to simulation function

3. **Updated MIT_Beer_Game.py**:
   - Added initial value parameters to `run_beer_game_simulation()`
   - Used `BeerGameAgent.create_agent()` for consistent initialization
   - Added initial values to hyperparameters logging

**Before/After Comparison**:
```python
# BEFORE: Fixed values, agents received 10 units in first round
agents = [BeerGameAgent(role_name=role, logger=logger) for role in roles]
shipments_in_transit = {0:10, 1:10}  # Hard-coded initial shipments

# AFTER: Configurable values, clean start
agents = [BeerGameAgent.create_agent(role_name=role, 
                                    initial_inventory=initial_inventory,
                                    initial_backlog=initial_backlog, 
                                    logger=logger) for role in roles]
shipments_in_transit = {0:0, 1:0}  # Zero initial shipments
```

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Start with default values (inventory=100, backlog=0)
python executeMITBeerGame.py --num_rounds 20

# Start with higher inventory and some backlog
python executeMITBeerGame.py --initial_inventory 150 --initial_backlog 10

# Test extreme conditions
python executeMITBeerGame.py --initial_inventory 50 --initial_backlog 25 --num_rounds 30
```

**Research Applications**:
- Test different market conditions (high/low initial stock)
- Simulate supply chain disruptions (agents start with backlog)
- Compare agent behavior under resource constraints vs abundance
- Study equilibrium convergence from different starting points

## üèõÔ∏è Background: The MIT Beer Game 

## Latest Changes Log

### 2025-06-27: LangSmith Integration Disabled to Avoid Rate Limits

**Issue**: The MIT Beer Game simulation was encountering LangSmith rate limit errors when trying to trace LLM calls, causing error messages to flood the output:
```
Failed to multipart ingest runs: langsmith.utils.LangSmithRateLimitError: Rate limit exceeded for https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs/multipart
```

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Disabled LangSmith in `llm_calls_mitb_game.py`**: 
   - Set `LANGSMITH_AVAILABLE = False` at the top of the file
   - Commented out the LangSmith import to prevent any tracing attempts
   - Created a no-op `traceable` decorator function

2. **Simplified `langraph_workflow.py`**:
   - Removed all LangGraph dependencies (StateGraph, END, etc.)
   - Created a simple sequential workflow that doesn't require LangGraph
   - Removed complex graph building and just runs nodes sequentially

**Result**: 
- Simulation now runs cleanly without LangSmith rate limit errors
- All functionality preserved: communication, decision making, memory, logging
- Performance improved with cleaner output
- Successfully completed 10-round simulation with 84 LLM calls costing $0.87

**Key Files Modified**:
- `Games/2_MIT_Beer_Game/scripts/llm_calls_mitb_game.py` - Disabled LangSmith tracing
- `Games/2_MIT_Beer_Game/scripts/langraph_workflow.py` - Simplified to remove LangGraph dependencies

**Command to Run Without LangSmith**:
```bash
python Games/2_MIT_Beer_Game/scripts/executeMITBeerGame.py --num_rounds 10 --initial_inventory 50 --initial_backlog 0 --temperature 0 --communication_rounds 1 --profit_per_unit_sold 1.5 --backlog_cost_per_unit 1
```

The simulation logic remains intact and the Beer Game mechanics work properly with the fixed order flow from previous iterations. 

## Latest Implementation - Bank Account Balance System (2025-01-XX)

### Major Feature: Bank Account Balance System
- **Replaced profit tracking with bank account balance system**
- **Initial balance**: $1000 per agent (configurable via CLI)
- **Bankruptcy detection**: Simulation terminates if any agent balance ‚â§ 0

#### Changes Made:
1. **Models (`models_mitb_game.py`)**:
   - Added `balance: float = 1000.0` field to `BeerGameAgent`
   - Added compatibility alias `profit_accumulated` ‚Üí `balance`
   - Updated `RoundData` to track: `starting_balance`, `revenue`, `purchase_cost`, `holding_cost`, `backlog_cost`, `ending_balance`
   - Modified `create_agent()` to accept `initial_balance` parameter

2. **Core Game Logic (`MIT_Beer_Game.py`)**:
   - **Revenue**: Added to balance when units are sold downstream
   - **Purchase costs**: Deducted immediately when orders are placed
   - **Holding/backlog costs**: Deducted each round based on inventory/backlog
   - **Bankruptcy check**: Simulation stops if any agent balance ‚â§ 0
   - Added monetary parameters: `sale_price_per_unit`, `purchase_cost_per_unit`, `production_cost_per_unit`

3. **CLI Interface (`executeMITBeerGame.py`)**:
   - Added `--initial_balance` argument (default: 1000.0)
   - Added `--sale_price`, `--purchase_cost`, `--production_cost` arguments
   - All monetary parameters configurable via command line

4. **Analysis (`analysis_mitb_game.py`)**:
   - Updated plots to use `ending_balance` instead of deprecated `profit` column
   - Fixed visualization compatibility with new data structure

#### Command Examples:
```bash
# Start with $500 balance, 0 backlog, 100 inventory
python executeMITBeerGame.py --initial_balance 500.0 --initial_backlog 0 --initial_inventory 100

# Custom pricing scenario
python executeMITBeerGame.py --sale_price 6.0 --purchase_cost 3.0 --production_cost 2.0 --initial_balance 2000.0
```

#### Cash Flow Logic:
1. **Each Round**:
   - Revenue: `units_sold √ó sale_price_per_unit` ‚Üí added to balance
   - Holding cost: `inventory √ó holding_cost_per_unit` ‚Üí deducted from balance  
   - Backlog cost: `backlog √ó backlog_cost_per_unit` ‚Üí deducted from balance
   - Purchase cost: `order_quantity √ó purchase_cost_per_unit` ‚Üí deducted from balance

2. **Bankruptcy Protection**:
   - If any agent's balance ‚â§ 0, simulation terminates with "Bankruptcy!" message
   - Prevents unrealistic negative cash flow scenarios

#### Prompt Updates Needed:
- [ ] Update LLM prompts to inform agents about cash constraints
- [ ] Add bankruptcy risk awareness to decision-making prompts
- [ ] Include balance information in strategy generation prompts

### 2025-06-30 - Chinese Whisper 2.0 SQL Evaluation Run

**Files Used:** `Games/8_Chinese_Whisper2.0/generate_sql.py`, `Games/8_Chinese_Whisper2.0/evaluate_sql.py`

**Change Description:**
- Successfully ran SQL evaluation on latest Chinese Whispers simulation (run_2025-06-30_18-32-24)
- Evaluated 26 SQL queries generated from story transformations across 25 agent steps
- Measured semantic drift by comparing result set sizes against baseline (step 5: 8 rows)
- Generated drift visualization plot showing semantic deviation over agent chain

**Key Results:**
- Several queries failed due to missing 'Olivia Hudson' records (expected for synthetic data)
- Significant drift observed: ranging from 0 (perfect match) to 56 rows difference
- Step 13 showed minimal drift (5 rows difference) while steps 11, 12, 17, 24 showed maximum drift (48-56 rows)
- Generated comprehensive evaluation log, results.json, and diff_vs_agent.png visualization

**Files Generated:**
- `evaluation.log` - Detailed execution log with query results
- `results.json` - Structured evaluation results with row counts and drift metrics  
- `diff_vs_agent.png` - Visualization of semantic drift across agent chain

**Impact:**
- Demonstrates measurable semantic drift in LLM chains through SQL result set analysis
- Provides quantitative metrics for evaluating information preservation in multi-agent transformations 

## Latest Changes (January 2025)

### Round Structure Analysis
**Current Round Types Available:**
- **Main Game Rounds** (`--num_rounds`): Core simulation rounds where agents make supply chain decisions
- **Communication Rounds** (`--communication_rounds`): Sub-rounds within each main round for agent message exchange
- **Memory Rounds** (`--memory_retention_rounds`): Number of past rounds agents retain in memory

**Orchestration Rounds: NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- No orchestration round option currently exists in the system
- Orchestration rounds would be special rounds for higher-level strategy coordination
- Could include supply chain alignment, demand forecasting coordination, risk management planning
- Feature request noted for potential future implementation

### Orchestrator Feature (NEW)
- Added LLM-based Orchestrator that provides recommended order quantities to each agent every round.
- CLI flags:
  * `--enable_orchestrator` ‚Äì turn on orchestrator phase.
  * `--orchestrator_history` ‚Äì how many past rounds are included in orchestrator prompt.
  * `--orchestrator_override` ‚Äì if set, agents are forced to follow orchestrator order.
- Logging:
  * `orchestrator_order` column in CSV/JSON.
  * Recommendations stored in aggregated JSON under `orchestrator_recommendations`.
- Visuals: Combined plot now includes "Orchestrator Recommended Orders" subplot.

### 2025-07-18 - Progress Summary PDF Generator

**Files Created:** `generate_progress_summary.py`, `docs/Progress_Summary_July2025.pdf`, updated `requirements.txt`

**Change Description:**
- Added an automated ReportLab-based script that compiles a three-page PDF summarising the entire repository status.
- Embedded four representative plots (Beer Game, Fishery, Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma) for quick visual inspection.
- Included new dependency `reportlab>=3.6.0` in `requirements.txt` and generated the first PDF at the indicated location.

### 2025-01-XX - Agent Information Access Investigation

**Investigation Focus:** Determined what information agents have access to during communication rounds

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: Agents have **complete access** to their current balance/status information during communication rounds
- Information includes: current inventory, backlog, total profit/balance, recent orders, last order placed, current strategy, and communication history
- **Implementation**: Information is passed via `generate_communication_message()` method in `models_mitb_game.py`
- **Prompt Structure**: Communication prompts include identical state information as decision-making prompts
- **Code Location**: `prompts_mitb_game.py` lines 200-205 show explicit inclusion of balance (`${profit_accumulated:.2f}`) in communication prompts

**Documentation Added:**
- Added "Agent Information Access During Communication" section to explain what data is available
- Updated "Key Simulation Features" to include "Full State Access" feature
- Confirmed agents can make informed communications based on their actual financial and inventory status

### 2025-01-XX - Enhanced Agent Historical Information Access

**Major Feature Enhancement:** Implemented comprehensive profit and balance history tracking for agents

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Profit History Tracking** - Agents now maintain `profit_history` list of last 10 rounds
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Balance History Tracking** - Agents now maintain `balance_history` list of last 10 rounds  
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Trend Analysis Methods** - Added `get_profit_trend()` and `get_balance_trend()` for strategic analysis
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Decision Prompts** - All decision-making phases now include comprehensive historical information
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Communication Prompts** - Communication rounds now include profit/balance history for better coordination
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Information Access** - Historical data passed to ALL phases: decision, communication, strategy updates

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Files Modified:** `models_mitb_game.py`, `prompts_mitb_game.py`, `langraph_workflow.py`, `MIT_Beer_Game.py`
- **New Agent Fields:** `profit_history: List[float]`, `balance_history: List[float]`
- **New Methods:** `update_profit_history()`, `get_profit_trend()`, `get_balance_trend()`
- **Updated Prompt Functions:** Enhanced all prompt generators with historical parameters

**Agent Information Now Includes:**
- Current inventory, backlog, balance
- Last round profit + profit history (last 10 rounds)
- Balance history (last 10 rounds) with trend analysis
- Recent demand/orders history
- Profit trend analysis ("Profitable trend", "Loss trend", "Improving", "Declining")
- Balance trend analysis ("Growing balance", "Declining balance", "Stable balance")

**Impact:** Agents can now make more informed decisions based on their financial trajectory and performance trends, enabling better strategic planning and risk management
