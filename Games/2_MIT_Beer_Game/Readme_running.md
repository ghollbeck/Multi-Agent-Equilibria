# MIT Beer Game - Comprehensive Development Log & Documentation

## 📚 WHAT IS THE MIT BEER GAME?

### **Educational Background**
The MIT Beer Game is a classic **supply chain management simulation** developed at the MIT Sloan School of Management in the 1960s by Jay Forrester and others. It demonstrates the **Bullwhip Effect** - how small changes in consumer demand can cause increasingly large swings in orders upstream in the supply chain.

### **Educational Objectives**
- **Bullwhip Effect**: Understanding how demand amplification occurs in supply chains
- **Information Asymmetry**: How lack of communication causes suboptimal decisions
- **Lead Time Impact**: Understanding delays and their effect on ordering behavior
- **Coordination Challenges**: Why local optimization often leads to global suboptimization
- **Cost Management**: Balancing holding costs, backlog costs, and service levels

### **Traditional Game Setup**
- **4 Roles**: Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory
- **Information Constraints**: Each player only sees orders from downstream (not end customer demand)
- **Lead Times**: 1-2 rounds between ordering and receiving inventory
- **Cost Structure**: Holding costs for excess inventory, backlog costs for unfilled orders
- **Goal**: Minimize individual total cost (holding + backlog costs)

### **Common Outcomes in Traditional Game**
- **Demand Amplification**: Small customer demand changes create huge upstream swings
- **Bullwhip Pattern**: Orders oscillate wildly as players over-correct
- **High Costs**: Poor coordination leads to either excess inventory or stockouts
- **Learning Effect**: Subsequent rounds often show improvement with better communication

## 🤖 LLM-ENHANCED MIT BEER GAME

### **Our Innovation: AI-Powered Agents**
This simulation replaces human players with **Large Language Model (LLM) agents** that:
- **Learn and Adapt**: Develop and update ordering strategies based on performance
- **Communicate**: Exchange information and coordinate (when enabled)
- **Remember**: Utilize memory systems to learn from past experiences
- **Optimize**: Maximize individual profit while considering supply chain dynamics

### **Key Simulation Features**
- **Role-Specific Prompts**: Each agent (Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor, Factory) receives tailored context
- **Realistic Constraints**: Shipment constraints prevent unrealistic oversupplying
- **Economic Modeling**: Holding costs ($0.50/unit/round), backlog costs ($1.50/unit/round), profits ($5.00/unit sold)
- **Dynamic Strategy**: Agents can update strategies between generations
- **Communication System**: Agents can coordinate via structured messaging
- **Memory Integration**: Past experiences inform future decisions

### **Supply Chain Flow**
```
External Demand → [Retailer] → [Wholesaler] → [Distributor] → [Factory] → Production
                      ↑           ↑            ↑           ↑
                   Orders      Orders       Orders      Orders
                      ↓           ↓            ↓           ↓
                  Shipments   Shipments   Shipments   Shipments
```

### **Agent Decision Process**
1. **Observe State**: Inventory, backlog, recent orders, incoming shipments
2. **Communicate**: Exchange information with other agents (if enabled)
3. **Decide Order**: Use LLM reasoning to determine optimal order quantity
4. **Execute**: Place orders and fulfill downstream demand
5. **Learn**: Update strategies based on performance and outcomes

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Summary**: Added explicit tracking of new orders received from downstream customers each round

**Changes Made**:
1. **Enhanced RoundData Structure** (`models_mitb_game.py`):
   - Added `order_received: int` parameter to track new orders from downstream customers
   - Now logs both what agents ordered upstream AND what they received from downstream

2. **Order Flow Tracking** (`MIT_Beer_Game.py`):
   - Added `orders_received_from_downstream` array to track new customer orders
   - Retailer: tracks `retailer_demand` (external customer demand)
   - Wholesaler: tracks `retailer_order` (orders from Retailer)
   - Distributor: tracks `wh_order` (orders from Wholesaler)
   - Factory: tracks `dist_order` (orders from Distributor)

3. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Human-readable logs now show "Orders received per agent" alongside shipments

- Better understanding of order flow vs shipment flow
- Clearer visibility into supply chain demand propagation
- Enhanced analysis of bullwhip effect patterns

**Key Distinction**:
- `order_received` = New orders from downstream customers (demand to fulfill)
- `shipment_received` = Goods received from upstream suppliers (inventory replenishment)
- `order_placed` = Orders sent to upstream suppliers
- `shipment_sent_downstream` = Goods shipped to downstream customers

### 🎯 Implementation 7: Enhanced Communication & Profit Optimization
**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Summary**: Enhanced communication prompts for profit-focused collaboration and updated default profit values

**Changes Made**:
1. **Enhanced Communication Prompts** (`prompts_mitb_game.py`):
   - Added "CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES" section emphasizing:
     - 📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Share current profit status and threats
     - 📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Transparently share inventory/backlog situation
     - 🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose total supply chain profit maximization
     - ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about market instability risks
   - Added "CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT" section with:
     - Lead time information (1 round for all orders)
     - Economics (holding $0.5, backlog $1.5, profit $2.5 per unit)
     - Shipment constraints and factory production details
   - Enhanced elaboration requirements for timing, costs, and stability

2. **Updated Default Profit Values**:

"Consider sharing: demand patterns, coordination suggestions..."

# After: Specific profit-focused objectives
"CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($X) and how decisions affect it
📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (X units) and backlog (Y units)
🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability"
```

**Research Impact**:
- Agents now explicitly discuss profit trajectories and threats
- Enhanced awareness of supply chain timing (1-round lead time)
- Tighter profit margins ($2.50 vs $5.00) create more challenging optimization
- Communication focuses on preventing total market collapse
- Better alignment between individual and collective profit goals

   - Added `create_agent()` class method for configurable initialization
   - Agents now start with zero shipments in transit for clean initial state

2. **Enhanced executeMITBeerGame.py**:
   - Added `--initial_inventory` parameter (default: 100)
   - Added `--initial_backlog` parameter (default: 0)
   - Parameters passed to simulation function

3. **Updated MIT_Beer_Game.py**:
   - Added initial value parameters to `run_beer_game_simulation()`
   - Used `BeerGameAgent.create_agent()` for consistent initialization
   - Added initial values to hyperparameters logging

**Before/After Comparison**:
```python
# BEFORE: Fixed values, agents received 10 units in first round
agents = [BeerGameAgent(role_name=role, logger=logger) for role in roles]
shipments_in_transit = {0:10, 1:10}  # Hard-coded initial shipments

# AFTER: Configurable values, clean start
agents = [BeerGameAgent.create_agent(role_name=role, 
                                    initial_inventory=initial_inventory,
                                    initial_backlog=initial_backlog, 
                                    logger=logger) for role in roles]
shipments_in_transit = {0:0, 1:0}  # Zero initial shipments
```

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Start with default values (inventory=100, backlog=0)
python executeMITBeerGame.py --num_rounds 20

# Start with higher inventory and some backlog
python executeMITBeerGame.py --initial_inventory 150 --initial_backlog 10

# Test extreme conditions
python executeMITBeerGame.py --initial_inventory 50 --initial_backlog 25 --num_rounds 30
```

**Research Applications**:
- Test different market conditions (high/low initial stock)
- Simulate supply chain disruptions (agents start with backlog)
- Compare agent behavior under resource constraints vs abundance
- Study equilibrium convergence from different starting points

## 🏛️ Background: The MIT Beer Game 

## Latest Changes Log

### 2025-06-27: LangSmith Integration Disabled to Avoid Rate Limits

**Issue**: The MIT Beer Game simulation was encountering LangSmith rate limit errors when trying to trace LLM calls, causing error messages to flood the output:
```
Failed to multipart ingest runs: langsmith.utils.LangSmithRateLimitError: Rate limit exceeded for https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs/multipart
```

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Disabled LangSmith in `llm_calls_mitb_game.py`**: 
   - Set `LANGSMITH_AVAILABLE = False` at the top of the file
   - Commented out the LangSmith import to prevent any tracing attempts
   - Created a no-op `traceable` decorator function

2. **Simplified `langraph_workflow.py`**:
   - Removed all LangGraph dependencies (StateGraph, END, etc.)
   - Created a simple sequential workflow that doesn't require LangGraph
   - Removed complex graph building and just runs nodes sequentially

**Result**: 
- Simulation now runs cleanly without LangSmith rate limit errors
- All functionality preserved: communication, decision making, memory, logging
- Performance improved with cleaner output
- Successfully completed 10-round simulation with 84 LLM calls costing $0.87

**Key Files Modified**:
- `Games/2_MIT_Beer_Game/scripts/llm_calls_mitb_game.py` - Disabled LangSmith tracing
- `Games/2_MIT_Beer_Game/scripts/langraph_workflow.py` - Simplified to remove LangGraph dependencies

**Command to Run Without LangSmith**:
```bash
python Games/2_MIT_Beer_Game/scripts/executeMITBeerGame.py --num_rounds 10 --initial_inventory 50 --initial_backlog 0 --temperature 0 --communication_rounds 1 --profit_per_unit_sold 1.5 --backlog_cost_per_unit 1
```

The simulation logic remains intact and the Beer Game mechanics work properly with the fixed order flow from previous iterations.
