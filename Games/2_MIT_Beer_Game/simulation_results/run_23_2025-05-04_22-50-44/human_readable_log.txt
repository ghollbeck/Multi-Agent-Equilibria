--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 37, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 13, Profit: 65.00, Total Profit: 46.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.85, rationale=Ordering 10 units keeps a buffer for expected demand while managing holding costs., risk_assessment=Potential for excess inventory due to demand fluctuations, but necessary to avoid stockouts., expected_demand_next_round=13
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "order_quantity": 10,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "rationale": "Given the initial inventory of 40 units and the profit per unit, ordering 10 units balances holding costs while preparing for future demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of overestimating demand, leading to excess inventory and increased holding costs.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12
}

        Given this state, how many units do you order from your upstream supplier 
        **this round**? Return valid JSON with:

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round

          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [18, 13, 10, 30]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 50, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 16, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: 287.0

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 50 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 16, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
