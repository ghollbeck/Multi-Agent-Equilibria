Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 124, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -33.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.85, rationale=Based on current trends and communication with the supply chain, demand is expected to increase, warranting a higher order to avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=The primary risk is overestimating demand, leading to higher holding costs, but underestimating could result in backlog costs., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=102, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8], llm_incoming=[8], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed a recent demand of 8 units, but I'm expecting a potential increase in demand up to 50 units next round. To avoid backlog and minimize costs, I plan to order 60 units. We should share more information on expected demand to better align our orders and inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update on demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: Greetings, team. I've noticed an upward trend in demand and I'm preparing for a potential increase by ordering more units. Let's keep communication open to manage this effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share weekly demand forecasts and inventory updates to reduce variability.
- Retailer: I have observed a demand of 8 units last round and anticipate an increase to 30 units in the next round. It's crucial we coordinate to align orders with actual demand and avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand of 8 units. To maintain stability and minimize costs, I plan to order 50 units to cover expected demand. Let's communicate closely to reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Suggest we share demand forecasts weekly to better align our orders.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've observed a recent demand of 8 units and anticipate an increase to 50 in the next round. To prevent backlog and reduce the bullwhip effect, it's important to maintain steady orders. I suggest we discuss expected demand trends and align our orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's align on expected demand for the coming rounds to stabilize our order quantities and reduce excess inventory.
- Factory: Greetings team. Currently, I'm observing a steady demand of around 8 units. I am planning to maintain a stable inventory by ordering 50 units to cover potential demand surges. Let's coordinate to ensure we have balanced inventories across the chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels to reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed a recent demand of 8 units, but I'm expecting a potential increase in demand up to 50 units next round. To avoid backlog and minimize costs, I plan to order 60 units. We should share more information on expected demand to better align our orders and inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update on demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: Greetings, team. I've noticed an upward trend in demand and I'm preparing for a potential increase by ordering more units. Let's keep communication open to manage this effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share weekly demand forecasts and inventory updates to reduce variability.
- Retailer: I have observed a demand of 8 units last round and anticipate an increase to 30 units in the next round. It's crucial we coordinate to align orders with actual demand and avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand of 8 units. To maintain stability and minimize costs, I plan to order 50 units to cover expected demand. Let's communicate closely to reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Suggest we share demand forecasts weekly to better align our orders.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've observed a recent demand of 8 units and anticipate an increase to 50 in the next round. To prevent backlog and reduce the bullwhip effect, it's important to maintain steady orders. I suggest we discuss expected demand trends and align our orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's align on expected demand for the coming rounds to stabilize our order quantities and reduce excess inventory.
- Factory: Greetings team. Currently, I'm observing a steady demand of around 8 units. I am planning to maintain a stable inventory by ordering 50 units to cover potential demand surges. Let's coordinate to ensure we have balanced inventories across the chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels to reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 125 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -22.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 13 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 39]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: 249.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've observed a spike in demand recently, which could indicate a trend. We should coordinate to avoid overreacting and causing a bullwhip effect. I'm maintaining a high inventory to buffer fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts each round to stabilize orders across the chain.
- Factory: Greetings team! I've observed a significant fluctuation in demand with recent orders being 8 and 99 units. I'm currently managing a backlog of 57 units and aiming to stabilize the inventory. Let's coordinate to smooth out these fluctuations.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts regularly to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed a steady demand pattern with recent orders of 8 and 9 units. I aim to maintain a stable inventory to minimize both backlog and holding costs. Let's share demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Propose regular sharing of demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents to synchronize orders.
- Wholesaler: Hello team, I've observed moderate demand with recent orders of 8 and 9 units. I'm maintaining a stable inventory of 103 units to cover expected demand and avoid backlogs. Let's coordinate to keep inventory levels balanced and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to reduce the bullwhip effect and align our order strategies.
- Distributor: I've noticed a significant spike in demand recently, and I'm preparing to handle larger orders to avoid backlogs. It's crucial we align our expectations and manage inventory carefully to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our anticipated demand forecasts regularly to ensure we are synchronized and reduce supply chain disruptions.
- Factory: To all agents, I've noticed significant variability in recent demands. Last two orders were 8 and 99 units. I am currently addressing a backlog of 57 units and have ordered 50 units, anticipating stable demand. Let's coordinate to minimize the bullwhip effect by sharing forecasts and inventory levels.
  Proposal: Suggest we all share our expected demand for the upcoming rounds to better align our orders and reduce sudden shortages or surpluses.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [8, 8, 8, 50]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: Hello team, I've observed a consistent increase in demand with recent orders being 8, 9, and 12 units. It's crucial we maintain a steady flow of inventory to minimize backlog and holding costs. Let's aim for better alignment to reduce the Bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining stable inventory levels to meet demand without overstocking.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts and current inventory levels to improve supply chain visibility.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 142 units with no backlog, and I'm forecasting a demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer mentioned an increase in demand with recent orders of 8, 9, and 12 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align more closely to manage inventory efficiently. Therefore, I will continue to maintain a stable inventory to meet expected demand and avoid backlogs.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining inventory levels that can meet demand without leading to excess stock or shortages.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a shared demand forecasting system to better anticipate order quantities and reduce the Bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 52 units, with no backlog. Forecasting a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer mentioned a consistent increase in demand and Retailer has no backlog with an expectation of a 30-unit demand. Wholesaler has confirmed similar observations, with a forecast of 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand is likely to remain high, and we must collaborate to maintain sufficient inventory without overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to align with these forecasts, aiming to minimize backlog and maximize profit.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with upstream forecasts to stabilize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular information-sharing protocol to synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels for better alignment.
  Information Shared: I currently have a zero inventory with a backlog of 68 units and expect a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.78
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both observed an increase in demand and are focusing on maintaining stable inventory levels. Distributor mentioned a high backlog and a similar demand expectation. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand is consistently high across the supply chain, and we must align our strategies to minimize costs and backlogs. Therefore, I will slightly increase my inventory buffer and suggest we synchronize our demand forecasts.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning inventory levels with shared demand forecasts to reduce volatility.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to share demand forecasts and inventory levels for improved coordination.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 19 units, with a recent demand pattern showing spikes and an expected demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.82
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler and Distributor both noted a rise in demand, with forecasts of 50 units. The Factory has acknowledged high demand and suggests coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely align our demand forecasts to prevent backlogs and excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units to keep a stable inventory and avoid overstocking.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining a balanced inventory to meet demand without excessive stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels through a weekly update to enhance coordination.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 142 units with no backlog, forecasting 30 units demand next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear that Retailer and Distributor noted increased demand, forecasting 50 units, while Factory suggested coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our forecasts is crucial to maintain inventory efficiency and minimize costs. Therefore, I will maintain a stable inventory by ordering 50 units this round to align with expected demand and avoid backlogs.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable inventory to meet demand while minimizing excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Propose a shared demand forecasting platform to synchronize our efforts and reduce the Bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 52 units with no backlog. Forecasting a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both forecast a demand of 50 units and have no backlog. Factory suggested increasing coordination to manage high demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our forecasts will help in minimizing backlogs and costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 60 units this round to address my current backlog and meet expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with upstream forecasts to stabilize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular information-sharing protocol to synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels for better alignment.
  Information Shared: I currently have a zero inventory with a backlog of 68 units and expect a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.78
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear that Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor are all forecasting a demand of 50 units and are focusing on maintaining stable inventory levels. Distributor mentioned a significant backlog, which indicates a need for better alignment across the chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand continues to be high, and we must coordinate closely to avoid backlogs and minimize costs. Therefore, I will maintain a strategic buffer in my inventory and suggest we synchronize our demand forecasting to mitigate the Bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain a strategic inventory buffer while synchronizing demand forecasts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital platform to update demand forecasts and inventory levels weekly.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 19 units, recent demand spikes, expecting demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.83

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 160, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 12, Profit: 60.00, Total Profit: -109.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.85, rationale=Given the recent demand trend and incoming shipments, maintaining an order quantity of 30 should cover expected demand while avoiding excess inventory., risk_assessment=The primary risk remains underestimating demand, leading to backlog, or overestimating, leading to higher holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=142, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8, 9, 12], llm_incoming=[42], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 142 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -28.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 68 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 65
          - Last round profit: 61.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (68 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've noticed an increasing trend in demand over recent rounds with orders escalating quickly. To stabilize our supply chain, let's synchronize our order quantities and share forecasted demands. This can help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a communication protocol where we share weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: Dear partners, I've observed fluctuating demand in recent weeks, with one significant spike. To better manage our supply chain and minimize costs, I suggest we improve communication on inventory levels and demand forecasts. This will help us avoid backlogs and excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly demand forecast sharing system to better synchronize our orders.
- Retailer: I've observed a consistent demand pattern averaging 10 units per round over the last three rounds. To mitigate the bullwhip effect, we should aim for consistent ordering based on realistic demand forecasts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better synchronize our orders and reduce unnecessary variability.
- Wholesaler: I've observed fluctuating demand with recent orders of 8, 9, and 12 units. To stabilize our supply chain, it's crucial we coordinate better on expected demand and inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts each round to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I've observed a significant increase in demand over the past few rounds. To manage this, I'm planning to maintain a higher order quantity to prevent backlog escalation. It's crucial for us to coordinate our ordering to dampen demand variability.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular information-sharing routine about our order quantities and inventory levels to better anticipate demand changes.
- Factory: We have observed fluctuating demand with recent orders being quite unpredictable. It's crucial we coordinate better to handle demand spikes efficiently.
  Proposal: Let's establish regular communication channels to share demand forecasts and inventory levels.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I've noticed a steady demand pattern with recent orders averaging around 9.67 units. To maintain stability and minimize the bullwhip effect, let's aim for consistent order sizes. My current inventory is 191 units, which is sufficient to meet expected demand, but I will order cautiously to avoid overstocking.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable inventory levels to reduce fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform to update each other on inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 191 units with no backlog. Recent demand has averaged 9.67 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer mentioned a steady demand pattern with an average of 9.67 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that a consistent approach will benefit us all by reducing the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain stable order quantities to match expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on consistent ordering to minimize fluctuations.

Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned stable demand averaging 9.67 units and the Wholesaler anticipates an increase to 50 units. The Factory also notes mixed demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to prepare for potential demand spikes while keeping our operations stable. Therefore, I will maintain a steady order size to manage our backlog and ensure a buffer against demand fluctuations. Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain a steady order size with a buffer for fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Establish a shared platform for real-time inventory and demand updates.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 0 units with a backlog of 26 units. Recent demand has been volatile, averaging 39.67 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear that both the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining a buffer to handle demand spikes, with the Wholesaler expecting demand to increase to 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand variability remains a significant factor, and we need to be prepared for fluctuations. Therefore, I will focus on clearing my backlog and placing orders to ensure a buffer while avoiding overstocking. Let's synchronize our strategies to enhance coordination and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain a buffer to handle demand fluctuations while clearing backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Create a shared platform for real-time updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 0 units with a backlog of 56 units. Last order placed was 100 units, and I expect demand to average 50 units next round.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 213, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -231.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.85, rationale=Considering the stable demand pattern and recent upstream communications indicating a potential rise, maintaining an order of 30 units should cover expected demand and provide a buffer., risk_assessment=Risk of underestimating demand leading to backlog, or overestimating resulting in high holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=191, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 12, 8], llm_incoming=[38], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 191 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 12, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -20.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've noticed a consistent increase in demand over the past few rounds, with recent orders being 39, 42, and 38. It's crucial we coordinate to manage this trend and avoid excessive backlogs. My inventory is currently at zero, with a backlog of 26 units. I'm planning to order 60 units to stabilize my supply for future demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts and current backlog levels to better align our order quantities.
- Factory: Our recent demand has shown significant fluctuations, with a recent surge peaking at 102 units. To avoid backlog issues, I suggest we align on expected demand forecasts and adjust orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared demand forecasting model to reduce the bullwhip effect and improve order accuracy across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I've noticed a steady demand pattern with recent orders averaging around 10 units per week. To minimize the risk of the bullwhip effect, I'm maintaining a stable inventory to cover expected demand. I suggest we all aim to keep our inventory levels aligned with realistic demand expectations to optimize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share demand forecasts and inventory levels periodically to better synchronize our supply chain operations.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed a stable demand pattern recently with orders around 10 units. To manage the supply chain efficiently, it's important we all communicate our expected demands and align our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and any capacity constraints at the beginning of each round.
- Distributor: I have noticed a consistent increase in demand over the past few rounds, with recent orders at 39, 42, and 38 units. This suggests a potential upward trend. To manage this effectively, I am currently out of inventory with a backlog of 26 units. It is crucial for us to coordinate better to reduce the bullwhip effect and ensure smoother operations.
  Proposal: Let's share weekly demand forecasts and adjust orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow.
- Factory: Hello team, I've noticed significant fluctuations in demand recently, which have impacted my inventory and backlog. I suggest we share more frequent updates on our inventory levels and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's implement weekly check-ins to share inventory levels and demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts and current backlog levels to better align our order quantities.
- Factory: Our recent demand has shown significant fluctuations, with a recent surge peaking at 102 units. To avoid backlog issues, I suggest we align on expected demand forecasts and adjust orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared demand forecasting model to reduce the bullwhip effect and improve order accuracy across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I've noticed a steady demand pattern with recent orders averaging around 10 units per week. To minimize the risk of the bullwhip effect, I'm maintaining a stable inventory to cover expected demand. I suggest we all aim to keep our inventory levels aligned with realistic demand expectations to optimize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share demand forecasts and inventory levels periodically to better synchronize our supply chain operations.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed a stable demand pattern recently with orders around 10 units. To manage the supply chain efficiently, it's important we all communicate our expected demands and align our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and any capacity constraints at the beginning of each round.
- Distributor: I have noticed a consistent increase in demand over the past few rounds, with recent orders at 39, 42, and 38 units. This suggests a potential upward trend. To manage this effectively, I am currently out of inventory with a backlog of 26 units. It is crucial for us to coordinate better to reduce the bullwhip effect and ensure smoother operations.
  Proposal: Let's share weekly demand forecasts and adjust orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow.
- Factory: Hello team, I've noticed significant fluctuations in demand recently, which have impacted my inventory and backlog. I suggest we share more frequent updates on our inventory levels and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's implement weekly check-ins to share inventory levels and demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (26 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Wholesaler: I've noticed a stable demand pattern recently with orders around 10 units. To manage the supply chain efficiently, it's important we all communicate our expected demands and align our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and any capacity constraints at the beginning of each round.
- Distributor: I have noticed a consistent increase in demand over the past few rounds, with recent orders at 39, 42, and 38 units. This suggests a potential upward trend. To manage this effectively, I am currently out of inventory with a backlog of 26 units. It is crucial for us to coordinate better to reduce the bullwhip effect and ensure smoother operations.
  Proposal: Let's share weekly demand forecasts and adjust orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow.
- Factory: Hello team, I've noticed significant fluctuations in demand recently, which have impacted my inventory and backlog. I suggest we share more frequent updates on our inventory levels and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's implement weekly check-ins to share inventory levels and demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 242 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -66.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a consistent demand from the Retailer with recent orders averaging around 41 units. With no inventory and a backlog of 56 units, I am focusing on stabilizing my supply chain to meet this demand efficiently. I suggest we all aim to synchronize our orders closely to the actual demand, which could help minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round to better coordinate our order quantities.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in demand recently, with a high spike which could indicate a trend. To stabilize our operations and reduce the bullwhip effect, let's focus on maintaining clearer communication about expected demand changes. I am currently managing a stable inventory and no backlog, but am cautious of potential demand surges.
  Proposal: Let's update each other on significant demand changes or unexpected orders as soon as possible to adjust our strategies accordingly.
- Retailer: I've observed that recent demand has been somewhat variable, averaging around 11 units over the last three rounds, but I expect it to rise to 30 units. To manage this, I'm keeping a larger inventory. I suggest we share demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order strategies.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly demand forecast sharing protocol among all agents to align our order quantities.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a fluctuating demand pattern with recent orders of 12, 8, and 13 units. To minimize the bullwhip effect, we should consider sharing our expected demands and order plans. Currently, I have an inventory of 18 units and no backlog, but I'm planning to order 50 units to cover expected demand spikes.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share forecasted demands and inventory levels, ensuring we align our order quantities to actual market needs.
- Distributor: I've observed that recent demand has been fluctuating slightly but remains around an average of 41 units. Given our current backlog and no inventory, it's crucial we coordinate more effectively to manage spikes in demand. I propose we share our expected demand projections and order plans to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform to update each other on real-time demand forecasts and order intentions.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, notably a surge two rounds ago. To stabilize our operations and reduce the bullwhip effect, I suggest more consistent order patterns and timely information sharing on demand forecasts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update on expected demand and inventory levels among all agents to better align our order quantities.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 18 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 123.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a consistent demand from the Retailer with recent orders averaging around 41 units. With no inventory and a backlog of 56 units, I am focusing on stabilizing my supply chain to meet this demand efficiently. I suggest we all aim to synchronize our orders closely to the actual demand, which could help minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round to better coordinate our order quantities.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in demand recently, with a high spike which could indicate a trend. To stabilize our operations and reduce the bullwhip effect, let's focus on maintaining clearer communication about expected demand changes. I am currently managing a stable inventory and no backlog, but am cautious of potential demand surges.
  Proposal: Let's update each other on significant demand changes or unexpected orders as soon as possible to adjust our strategies accordingly.
- Retailer: I've observed that recent demand has been somewhat variable, averaging around 11 units over the last three rounds, but I expect it to rise to 30 units. To manage this, I'm keeping a larger inventory. I suggest we share demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order strategies.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly demand forecast sharing protocol among all agents to align our order quantities.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a fluctuating demand pattern with recent orders of 12, 8, and 13 units. To minimize the bullwhip effect, we should consider sharing our expected demands and order plans. Currently, I have an inventory of 18 units and no backlog, but I'm planning to order 50 units to cover expected demand spikes.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share forecasted demands and inventory levels, ensuring we align our order quantities to actual market needs.
- Distributor: I've observed that recent demand has been fluctuating slightly but remains around an average of 41 units. Given our current backlog and no inventory, it's crucial we coordinate more effectively to manage spikes in demand. I propose we share our expected demand projections and order plans to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform to update each other on real-time demand forecasts and order intentions.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, notably a surge two rounds ago. To stabilize our operations and reduce the bullwhip effect, I suggest more consistent order patterns and timely information sharing on demand forecasts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update on expected demand and inventory levels among all agents to better align our order quantities.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 102, 73]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 150
          - Last round profit: 343.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a consistent demand from the Retailer with recent orders averaging around 41 units. With no inventory and a backlog of 56 units, I am focusing on stabilizing my supply chain to meet this demand efficiently. I suggest we all aim to synchronize our orders closely to the actual demand, which could help minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round to better coordinate our order quantities.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in demand recently, with a high spike which could indicate a trend. To stabilize our operations and reduce the bullwhip effect, let's focus on maintaining clearer communication about expected demand changes. I am currently managing a stable inventory and no backlog, but am cautious of potential demand surges.
  Proposal: Let's update each other on significant demand changes or unexpected orders as soon as possible to adjust our strategies accordingly.
- Retailer: I've observed that recent demand has been somewhat variable, averaging around 11 units over the last three rounds, but I expect it to rise to 30 units. To manage this, I'm keeping a larger inventory. I suggest we share demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order strategies.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly demand forecast sharing protocol among all agents to align our order quantities.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a fluctuating demand pattern with recent orders of 12, 8, and 13 units. To minimize the bullwhip effect, we should consider sharing our expected demands and order plans. Currently, I have an inventory of 18 units and no backlog, but I'm planning to order 50 units to cover expected demand spikes.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share forecasted demands and inventory levels, ensuring we align our order quantities to actual market needs.
- Distributor: I've observed that recent demand has been fluctuating slightly but remains around an average of 41 units. Given our current backlog and no inventory, it's crucial we coordinate more effectively to manage spikes in demand. I propose we share our expected demand projections and order plans to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform to update each other on real-time demand forecasts and order intentions.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, notably a surge two rounds ago. To stabilize our operations and reduce the bullwhip effect, I suggest more consistent order patterns and timely information sharing on demand forecasts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update on expected demand and inventory levels among all agents to better align our order quantities.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have noticed a recent surge in demand from the Retailer, averaging around 44 units over the last three rounds. It's crucial we communicate demand trends promptly to avoid backlog and excess inventory issues.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly update system where we share our respective demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our supply chain activities.
- Factory: I have noticed a significant fluctuation in recent demand, with orders ranging from 73 to 107 units. This suggests potential volatility in the market. My inventory is currently depleted, and I face a backlog of 12 units. I'm aiming to stabilize my inventory while addressing this backlog. I recommend we all share our expected demand forecasts to align our order quantities better and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular weekly update on expected demand and inventory levels to improve our collective response to demand changes.
- Retailer: I've noticed our recent demand is fluctuating around an average of about 12 units, with a peak demand of 16 units. To prevent the bullwhip effect, let's aim to keep our orders aligned with actual consumer demand trends. I'll be ordering 30 units this round in anticipation of a slight increase in demand.
  Proposal: Let's each focus on sharing our anticipated demand for the next round to better align our supply chain decisions.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed a steady increase in demand over the past three rounds, with orders rising from 8 to 16 units. To manage this, I've maintained a stable inventory of 51 units to mitigate potential fluctuations. It's crucial we coordinate to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Let's share weekly demand updates to better align our order quantities.
  Proposal: Let's establish a system for sharing weekly demand forecasts across the supply chain.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed a trend of increasing demand with recent orders at 38, 43, and 51 units. To address this and avoid any potential backlog, I plan to order 60 units this round. Let's align our strategies to ensure a smooth flow and minimize the bullwhip effect. Sharing demand forecasts could be beneficial for all.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand data exchange to enhance decision-making across the supply chain.
- Factory: I've noticed fluctuating demand in recent rounds, with a significant backlog of 12 units due to high demand. It's important we coordinate better to avoid the bullwhip effect. Let's synchronize order quantities based on realistic demand forecasting.
  Proposal: I propose we share expected demand and inventory levels at each stage to better align our orders and reduce costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 51 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 16]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: 90.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have noticed a recent surge in demand from the Retailer, averaging around 44 units over the last three rounds. It's crucial we communicate demand trends promptly to avoid backlog and excess inventory issues.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly update system where we share our respective demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our supply chain activities.
- Factory: I have noticed a significant fluctuation in recent demand, with orders ranging from 73 to 107 units. This suggests potential volatility in the market. My inventory is currently depleted, and I face a backlog of 12 units. I'm aiming to stabilize my inventory while addressing this backlog. I recommend we all share our expected demand forecasts to align our order quantities better and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular weekly update on expected demand and inventory levels to improve our collective response to demand changes.
- Retailer: I've noticed our recent demand is fluctuating around an average of about 12 units, with a peak demand of 16 units. To prevent the bullwhip effect, let's aim to keep our orders aligned with actual consumer demand trends. I'll be ordering 30 units this round in anticipation of a slight increase in demand.
  Proposal: Let's each focus on sharing our anticipated demand for the next round to better align our supply chain decisions.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed a steady increase in demand over the past three rounds, with orders rising from 8 to 16 units. To manage this, I've maintained a stable inventory of 51 units to mitigate potential fluctuations. It's crucial we coordinate to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Let's share weekly demand updates to better align our order quantities.
  Proposal: Let's establish a system for sharing weekly demand forecasts across the supply chain.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed a trend of increasing demand with recent orders at 38, 43, and 51 units. To address this and avoid any potential backlog, I plan to order 60 units this round. Let's align our strategies to ensure a smooth flow and minimize the bullwhip effect. Sharing demand forecasts could be beneficial for all.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand data exchange to enhance decision-making across the supply chain.
- Factory: I've noticed fluctuating demand in recent rounds, with a significant backlog of 12 units due to high demand. It's important we coordinate better to avoid the bullwhip effect. Let's synchronize order quantities based on realistic demand forecasting.
  Proposal: I propose we share expected demand and inventory levels at each stage to better align our orders and reduce costs.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have noticed a recent surge in demand from the Retailer, averaging around 44 units over the last three rounds. It's crucial we communicate demand trends promptly to avoid backlog and excess inventory issues.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly update system where we share our respective demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our supply chain activities.
- Factory: I have noticed a significant fluctuation in recent demand, with orders ranging from 73 to 107 units. This suggests potential volatility in the market. My inventory is currently depleted, and I face a backlog of 12 units. I'm aiming to stabilize my inventory while addressing this backlog. I recommend we all share our expected demand forecasts to align our order quantities better and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular weekly update on expected demand and inventory levels to improve our collective response to demand changes.
- Retailer: I've noticed our recent demand is fluctuating around an average of about 12 units, with a peak demand of 16 units. To prevent the bullwhip effect, let's aim to keep our orders aligned with actual consumer demand trends. I'll be ordering 30 units this round in anticipation of a slight increase in demand.
  Proposal: Let's each focus on sharing our anticipated demand for the next round to better align our supply chain decisions.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed a steady increase in demand over the past three rounds, with orders rising from 8 to 16 units. To manage this, I've maintained a stable inventory of 51 units to mitigate potential fluctuations. It's crucial we coordinate to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Let's share weekly demand updates to better align our order quantities.
  Proposal: Let's establish a system for sharing weekly demand forecasts across the supply chain.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed a trend of increasing demand with recent orders at 38, 43, and 51 units. To address this and avoid any potential backlog, I plan to order 60 units this round. Let's align our strategies to ensure a smooth flow and minimize the bullwhip effect. Sharing demand forecasts could be beneficial for all.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand data exchange to enhance decision-making across the supply chain.
- Factory: I've noticed fluctuating demand in recent rounds, with a significant backlog of 12 units due to high demand. It's important we coordinate better to avoid the bullwhip effect. Let's synchronize order quantities based on realistic demand forecasting.
  Proposal: I propose we share expected demand and inventory levels at each stage to better align our orders and reduce costs.

Let's work together to minimize the bullwhip effect by sharing insights on demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our weekly demand forecasts and order quantities to better synchronize our supply chain activities.
- Factory: I've observed fluctuating demand with recent spikes reaching up to 107 units, which suggests a need for improved coordination to mitigate the bullwhip effect. I propose we share our upcoming order forecasts to better align our production and inventory levels, thereby reducing the likelihood of backlogs and excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update on expected demand and order forecasts among all agents to synchronize our supply chain activities.
- Retailer: I've observed a stable demand trend averaging around 14 units over the past few rounds. To maintain efficiency and reduce the bullwhip effect, I suggest we each aim for consistent order sizes that reflect true demand rather than anticipated spikes. This will help stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our expected demand forecasts each round to better synchronize orders.
- Wholesaler: Hello team, I've noticed a steady demand trend in the past weeks with an average of 14 units. I aim to maintain a stable inventory to cover expected demand and avoid backlogs. Let's coordinate to ensure smooth flow and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce variability.
- Distributor: I have observed fluctuating demand in recent rounds, averaging around 45-50 units. To maintain supply stability and minimize the bullwhip effect, I recommend aligning our order quantities closely to actual demand trends. I'm currently placing an order of 60 units to ensure coverage while minimizing excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share weekly demand forecasts to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noticed recent demand has been quite volatile, with significant surges. It's crucial for us all to communicate effectively to manage inventory and reduce the bullwhip effect. Currently, I'm out of inventory and facing a backlog of 37 units, which I plan to address by maintaining a steady order quantity.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts to better align our order quantities and reduce variability.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

This will help stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our expected demand forecasts each round to better synchronize orders.
- Wholesaler: Hello team, I've noticed a steady demand trend in the past weeks with an average of 14 units. I aim to maintain a stable inventory to cover expected demand and avoid backlogs. Let's coordinate to ensure smooth flow and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce variability.
- Distributor: I have observed fluctuating demand in recent rounds, averaging around 45-50 units. To maintain supply stability and minimize the bullwhip effect, I recommend aligning our order quantities closely to actual demand trends. I'm currently placing an order of 60 units to ensure coverage while minimizing excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share weekly demand forecasts to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noticed recent demand has been quite volatile, with significant surges. It's crucial for us all to communicate effectively to manage inventory and reduce the bullwhip effect. Currently, I'm out of inventory and facing a backlog of 37 units, which I plan to address by maintaining a steady order quantity.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts to better align our order quantities and reduce variability.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 37 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [73, 107, 83]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 106
          - Last round profit: 277.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (37 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 8 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [51, 107, 165, 106]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: Hello, everyone. I've noticed a stable demand pattern over the last few rounds, averaging around 12.67 units per week. This suggests a consistent demand from our customers. To optimize our supply chain, we should aim to synchronize our orders based on expected demand to prevent overstocking and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I am maintaining a stable order quantity to align with observed demand and minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts each round to better align our orders and reduce variability across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 372 units, with no backlog. Recent demand: [16, 13, 9].
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a stable demand pattern with an average of 12.67 units per week. This aligns with my observations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady order quantity is beneficial for minimizing costs and reducing the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue with a stable ordering strategy while closely monitoring demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain steady orders based on expected demand to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts and current inventory levels each round to better synchronize our orders and optimize the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 163 units, with no backlog. Recent demand: [16, 13, 9]. Expected demand next round: 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a stable demand pattern averaging 12.67 units per week, and the Wholesaler is observing similar patterns. This aligns with recent demand trends I've seen, averaging 44.33 units over the last three weeks, suggesting a higher demand at our level. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should maintain a stable order quantity while preparing for potential demand spikes. Therefore, I will continue to order 60 units, aiming to avoid backlogs and excessive inventory costs.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stability in orders to balance demand and inventory costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align supply chain operations and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 102 units with no backlog. Recent demand averages 44.33 units per week.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all mentioned a stable demand pattern with slight variations at each level. My recent demand has been higher, averaging around 91.33 units over the last three weeks. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is stability, there's also potential for demand spikes at the factory level. Therefore, I will maintain a stable order quantity but prepare for possible fluctuations by slightly adjusting my inventory strategy.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable orders with a buffer for potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our supply chain and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 27 units with no backlog. Recent demand averages 91.33 units per week.
  Confidence: 0.82
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned stable demand patterns, with slight variations at different levels. The Factory also noted potential for demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that while maintaining stability, we should also prepare for unexpected demand increases. Therefore, I will continue with a stable order quantity of 30 to align with observed demand and avoid overstocking. Let's focus on sharing our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels to better synchronize our efforts.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain a stable order quantity to match demand while preparing for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose sharing expected demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to align our supply chain operations.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 372 units with no backlog, and recent demand was [16, 13, 9].
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer, Distributor, and Factory have all noted stable demand patterns with potential for spikes at higher levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining stable orders is critical, but we must remain vigilant for sudden changes. Therefore, I will continue with my stable ordering strategy to cover expected demand and prepare for fluctuations. Let's focus on sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our efforts.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable orders based on expected demand while preparing for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's consistently share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to synchronize our supply chain operations.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 163 units, no backlog, recent demand was [16, 13, 9], expected demand next round is 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler have both mentioned stable demand patterns, averaging around 12.67 units per week. The Factory has noted potential demand spikes, averaging 91.33 units recently. This aligns with my observed demand pattern of 44.33 units average over the last three weeks. Based on this, my conclusion is that while maintaining stability, we should prepare for fluctuations. Therefore, I will continue with a stable order quantity of 60 units to avoid backlogs and manage inventory costs effectively.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable orders while preparing for potential demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to align our supply chain operations and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 102 units with no backlog. Recent demand averaged 44.33 units per week.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor have both mentioned stable demand patterns with potential for spikes, aligning with the Retailer's observations. My recent demand has been significant, averaging 91.33 units, indicating a pattern of high demand at the factory level. Based on this, my conclusion is that while stability is key, we must be prepared for demand surges. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to manage inventory effectively while preparing for potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable orders with a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our supply chain and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 27 units with no backlog. Recent demand averages 91.33 units per week.
  Confidence: 0.82

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 393, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -946.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.85, rationale=Based on recent demand trends and communications, maintaining a stable inventory with a buffer for variability is key. I expect a demand of 30 units, aligning with previous patterns and upstream forecasts., risk_assessment=The main risk is underestimating demand, leading to potential stockouts. Overestimation could increase holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=372, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[16, 13, 9], llm_incoming=[39], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 372 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -100.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed a steady demand with slight fluctuations, averaging around 44 units recently. To better align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect, I suggest we focus on consistent order patterns. My current inventory is stable at 102 units, and I foresee a demand of about 50 units in the next round. Let's aim for steady communication to manage our collective inventory levels efficiently.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a regular update cycle to share demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: Greetings Team, I've noticed a decrease in demand over the past three weeks, with recent orders dropping from 107 to 84 units. This suggests a trend that may continue. To adapt, I propose we align our order quantities to better match this trend and prevent excessive inventory or backlogs. I'm maintaining an inventory of 27 units and plan to order 50 units to stabilize my stock levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our order forecasts and inventory levels regularly to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed a consistent demand pattern over the last three rounds with an average demand of about 12.67 units. Given this trend, I'm planning to maintain a stable inventory to prevent overstocking and reduce holding costs. I propose we coordinate more closely on expected demand projections to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our order quantities and stabilize the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed a slight decrease in recent demand, but I'm projecting an increase to 50 units for the next round. To prevent stockouts and minimize costs, we should consider aligning our order quantities closely with expected demand. This could help us stabilize inventory levels and reduce backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've observed a stable demand trend with a slight increase over the past weeks. Maintaining a steady inventory level is crucial to prevent backlog and minimize costs. Let's work together to ensure smooth operations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts at the start of each round to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a fluctuating demand pattern in recent rounds, which could lead to variability in order quantities. Maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial to prevent backlogs. Let's work together to anticipate demand changes more effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts for the next round to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [51, 43, 39]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [144]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: 214.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed a steady demand with slight fluctuations, averaging around 44 units recently. To better align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect, I suggest we focus on consistent order patterns. My current inventory is stable at 102 units, and I foresee a demand of about 50 units in the next round. Let's aim for steady communication to manage our collective inventory levels efficiently.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a regular update cycle to share demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: Greetings Team, I've noticed a decrease in demand over the past three weeks, with recent orders dropping from 107 to 84 units. This suggests a trend that may continue. To adapt, I propose we align our order quantities to better match this trend and prevent excessive inventory or backlogs. I'm maintaining an inventory of 27 units and plan to order 50 units to stabilize my stock levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our order forecasts and inventory levels regularly to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed a consistent demand pattern over the last three rounds with an average demand of about 12.67 units. Given this trend, I'm planning to maintain a stable inventory to prevent overstocking and reduce holding costs. I propose we coordinate more closely on expected demand projections to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our order quantities and stabilize the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed a slight decrease in recent demand, but I'm projecting an increase to 50 units for the next round. To prevent stockouts and minimize costs, we should consider aligning our order quantities closely with expected demand. This could help us stabilize inventory levels and reduce backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've observed a stable demand trend with a slight increase over the past weeks. Maintaining a steady inventory level is crucial to prevent backlog and minimize costs. Let's work together to ensure smooth operations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts at the start of each round to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a fluctuating demand pattern in recent rounds, which could lead to variability in order quantities. Maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial to prevent backlogs. Let's work together to anticipate demand changes more effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts for the next round to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I've noticed a steady demand pattern with recent orders averaging around 10 units. I'm maintaining a stable inventory level to meet expected demand while avoiding overstocking. Let's coordinate more closely to minimize the Bullwhip effect and optimize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable inventory levels to avoid excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand estimates regularly to align our ordering strategies and reduce variability.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 426 units with no backlog, and expected demand for the next round is 30 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer mentioned a steady demand pattern averaging around 10 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a stable inventory to cover about 50 units should suffice to meet demand, aligning with my expected demand for the next round. Therefore, I will continue ordering to maintain this inventory level. Let's collaborate by sharing demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable inventory levels to meet expected demand and avoid overstocking.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update on demand forecasts to better align our ordering strategies and reduce variability.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 226 units with no backlog, and expected demand for the next round is 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer mentioned a steady demand pattern with orders averaging 10 units and Wholesaler is maintaining an inventory to cover about 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is to align our inventory management closely to prevent the bullwhip effect while ensuring demand fulfillment. Therefore, I will aim to maintain an inventory that can cover around 50 units of expected demand, similar to the Wholesaler's approach, and adjust orders as needed.
  Strategy Hint: Align inventory levels with demand trends to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a bi-weekly demand forecast sharing system to better align our strategies and reduce variability.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 95 units with no backlog, and expected demand for the next round is 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.82
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all mentioned maintaining stable inventory levels to match expected demand around 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a stable flow of production is crucial to meeting these expectations without causing excess backlogs or inventory costs. Therefore, I will continue to place orders aligned with the expected demand of 50 units to ensure a smooth supply chain flow.
  Strategy Hint: Align production with downstream demand to ensure stability and reduce costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for forecasting demand trends to ensure our inventory strategies are aligned.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is at 0 units with a backlog of 4 units, and I plan to order 50 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear that all agents are aligning around a stable inventory level to meet an expected demand of about 50 units. This confirms a need for us to align and predict demand more accurately. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should continue to maintain stable inventory levels while closely monitoring demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will uphold my strategy to maintain an inventory that meets expected demand while avoiding excess. Let's continue to share demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable inventory levels to cover expected demand and avoid overstocking.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for real-time demand and inventory updates to enhance our alignment.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer mentioned maintaining stable inventory levels and aligning on a demand of about 50 units. Distributor and Factory echoed similar strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that our alignment on expected demand is solid, and maintaining this approach should reduce variability and costs. Therefore, I will continue to order to cover this expected demand and suggest we formalize a weekly demand forecast sharing system to further optimize our alignment and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable inventory levels to meet expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a weekly demand forecast sharing system for better alignment.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 226 units with no backlog, and expected demand for the next round is 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler mentioned maintaining stable inventory levels to meet an expected demand of about 50 units. This aligns with the Factory's approach to maintain a consistent production flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a stable inventory to cover around 50 units of demand while closely monitoring any fluctuation is crucial for all of us. Therefore, I will continue with my current strategy to maintain an inventory level that meets the expected demand while minimizing the risk of excess. Let's enhance our collaboration by establishing a bi-weekly demand and inventory update to refine our alignment.
  Strategy Hint: Align inventory levels with demand trends to minimize costs and risks.
  Collaboration Proposal: Establish a bi-weekly demand and inventory update system for better alignment.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 95 units with no backlog, and expected demand for the next round is 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.82
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear from the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor that everyone is focusing on maintaining stable inventory levels to meet an expected demand around 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that ensuring a consistent production flow is essential to prevent backlogs and maintain supply chain efficiency. Therefore, I will continue placing orders to align with the expected demand of 50 units while addressing my current backlog. Let's improve our collaboration by establishing a shared platform for real-time demand and inventory updates to better align our strategies.
  Strategy Hint: Align production with downstream demand to ensure stability and reduce costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Establish a shared platform for real-time demand and inventory updates.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 0 units with a backlog of 4 units, and I plan to order 50 units for the next round.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 426 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -151.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)

        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 95 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [43, 39, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [156]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 70
          - Last round profit: 210.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I am observing a steady increase in demand, with recent orders at 43, 39, and 40 units. To ensure we minimize the bullwhip effect, I suggest aligning our orders closely with actual demand trends. I plan to order 60 units this round to maintain a balance between inventory and backlog risks.
  Proposal: Let's regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align orders and reduce excess inventory costs.
- Factory: Given recent demand surges and my current backlog of 4 units, I recommend we all focus on stabilizing our orders to avoid further amplification of the bullwhip effect. I plan to order 50 units this round to balance my inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on recent demand trends to smooth out supply chain fluctuations.
- Retailer: I have observed a steady demand pattern with recent orders around 10 units per week. To avoid the bullwhip effect, let's aim for stable ordering practices. My inventory is currently high at 426 units, which I plan to gradually reduce while maintaining service levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing weekly demand forecasts to improve synchronization across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed recent demand has been stable around 10 units. I plan to order 50 units to maintain a stable inventory and avoid backlogs. Let's share our expected demand to better synchronize orders and reduce volatility.
  Proposal: Share expected demand forecasts to align our order quantities and reduce bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed that our recent demand has been slightly increasing, with an average of 40.67 units. I'm aiming to maintain a stable inventory to meet this demand without overstocking. Let's collaborate to better anticipate demand changes and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our collective responsiveness.
- Factory: I've noticed a consistent high demand in recent rounds, with orders reaching up to 90 units. This suggests a strong ongoing consumer demand. I aim to keep my inventory aligned with expected demand and manage backlogs effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share demand forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to minimize the bullwhip effect and coordinate better.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 10 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [39, 84, 144, 74]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have noticed a steady demand with recent orders averaging around 10-13 units. To avoid overstocking, I suggest we all aim for stable inventory levels. This will help us minimize costs and prevent the Bullwhip effect. Also, I am maintaining an inventory level that is slightly above my expected demand to manage any sudden increases.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining stable inventory levels to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's consider sharing our expected demand forecasts to better synchronize our orders and reduce uncertainties.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 472 units with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer mentioned a steady demand pattern of 10-13 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a buffer inventory is essential to manage unexpected spikes. Therefore, I will continue ordering slightly above the expected demand to ensure stability. To further optimize, let's consider aligning our order schedules to reduce overproduction and stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining a buffer inventory to ensure stability.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 472 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -173.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 116 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [39, 40, 43]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [104]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: 172.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: Hello team, I've noticed a steady increase in demand over the past few rounds. To manage this and prevent backlog, I'm maintaining my order quantity to stay ahead. Sharing demand trends could help us all reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular information-sharing routine about demand forecasts and inventory levels to better synchronize our orders.
- Factory: I have noticed a consistent high demand pattern recently, with our recent orders averaging around 86 units. Given our current backlog, it's crucial we synchronize efforts to prevent further disruptions. I'm working with zero inventory, which means any increase in demand could significantly affect my ability to fulfill orders promptly.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly demand forecast sharing to improve our order accuracy and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I've noticed a stable demand pattern around 10-13 units recently. To avoid the Bullwhip effect, let's aim for consistent ordering. My inventory is currently 472 units with no backlog, so I'm in a good position to meet demand. If we all share our inventory and demand forecasts, we can better align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time inventory and demand updates.
- Wholesaler: I've observed a slight increase in demand over the past few rounds. To avoid the bullwhip effect, I suggest we all aim for stable orders and share any anticipated demand changes. My inventory is currently sufficient to meet current demands, and I'm planning to order 50 units to ensure stability.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular exchange of expected demand forecasts to align our orders more closely.
- Distributor: I've observed a steady increase in demand over the last three rounds, with recent orders averaging around 40 units. This trend suggests a potential rise in demand, so we should prepare accordingly. To prevent the bullwhip effect, let's focus on aligning our order quantities more closely with actual demand rather than speculative increases.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts and any significant changes in order patterns to improve synchronization.
- Factory: I've noticed a consistent high demand trend over the past rounds with recent orders at 84, 90, and 83 units. It's important we coordinate to address these fluctuations and reduce backlogs effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust orders collectively to stabilize the supply chain.

        Other agents in the supply chain: Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor
        
        Previous communication history:
        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:
