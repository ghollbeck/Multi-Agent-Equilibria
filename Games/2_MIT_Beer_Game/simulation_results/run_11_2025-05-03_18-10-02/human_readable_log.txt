        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
