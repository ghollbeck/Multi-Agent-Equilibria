--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 42, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: 19.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.85, rationale=Ordering 10 units balances current inventory and expected demand, ensuring adequate stock while minimizing holding costs., risk_assessment=Risk of overstocking exists, but maintaining a buffer is crucial to prevent stockouts during demand fluctuations., expected_demand_next_round=12
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "order_quantity": 10,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "rationale": "Based on current inventory and expected demand, ordering 10 units will help maintain stock without excessive holding costs while preparing for potential demand increases.",
  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of overestimating demand, which could lead to higher holding costs if demand does not meet expectations. Conversely, underordering could lead to backlog costs if demand increases unexpectedly.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12

        Given this state, how many units do you order from your upstream supplier 
        **this round**? Return valid JSON with:

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [24, 22, 15, 20]

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [25]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
