Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 97, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 13, Profit: 65.00, Total Profit: 16.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=Ordering 30 units aligns with expected demand and maintains inventory buffer., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could lead to excess inventory or stockouts if not monitored., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=97, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[13], llm_incoming=[13], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

I also note that Wholesaler plans to adjust their order to match the anticipated demand of 30 units next round, and Distributor will maintain their order quantity of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to meet the expected demand effectively while managing our inventory levels. Therefore, I will order 50 units next round to maintain a buffer and ensure we can fulfill the anticipated demand while reducing the risk of stockouts.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand impacting their inventory levels. This aligns with my observation of recent demand trends, which have shown a slight decrease in orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to better match the expected demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 30 units to ensure I have enough stock while minimizing backlog risks.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining a buffer while closely monitoring demand trends to avoid backlogs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our ordering strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have an inventory of 96 units and no backlog, with expected demand for the next round set at 30 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says:

  Collaboration Proposal: 
  Information Shared: 
  Confidence: 0.5
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand and suggested maintaining their order quantity at 30 units to minimize backlog risks. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to align better with expected demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to ensure I remain prepared for future demand while avoiding backlog risks.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning order quantities with expected demand to minimize backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular communication regarding our demand forecasts to coordinate our order strategies effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have an inventory of 36 units and no backlog, with expected demand for the next round set at 20 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 30 units to avoid excess inventory based on observed demand trends. I also hear the Distributor mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units for similar reasons. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our order quantities to align better with demand and avoid excess stock. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units, as I anticipate a demand of 50 units next round and want to ensure we can fulfill this without creating backlogs.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning our orders with expected demand is crucial to prevent stockouts and excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory is at 6 units, and I am expecting a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Distributor mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units to avoid backlog risks, and the Factory stated they will maintain their order at 50 units anticipating higher demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the Distributor is cautious, the Factory expects a significant increase in demand. This discrepancy could lead to misalignment in our inventories. Therefore, I will continue with my order of 30 units to maintain a balance and ensure I can meet demand without creating excess inventory or backlog.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining a balanced order quantity while monitoring demand trends can help prevent excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels regularly to align our order strategies more effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have an inventory of 96 units and no backlog, with expected demand for the next round set at 30 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will continue with their order of 30 units to maintain a balance, and the Distributor mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units to avoid backlog risks. I also hear the Factory expects higher demand and plans to order 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we have varying perspectives on demand which could lead to misalignment in our inventories. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 30 units to align with the Retailer's strategy while ensuring I have sufficient stock to meet any potential increases in demand.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning order quantities to match expected demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our order strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have an inventory of 66 units and no backlog, with expected demand for the next round set at 30 units.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned they will continue with their order of 30 units to maintain a balance amidst demand fluctuations, and the Wholesaler plans to align their order with the Retailer for similar reasons. Additionally, the Factory expects higher demand and is ordering 50 units to fulfill this without creating backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is a consensus on cautious ordering, the Factory's higher expectations could lead to potential mismatches in our inventories. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units as I believe it's prudent given my current inventory level of 36 units and the anticipated demand of 20 units next round. I suggest we all coordinate our orders closely to mitigate any inventory discrepancies.
  Strategy Hint: Cautiously aligning order quantities with anticipated demand to avoid backlogs and excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose regular sharing of our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect within the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have an inventory of 36 units and no backlog, with expected demand for the next round set at 20 units.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 96 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)

Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units, as I anticipate a demand of 50 units next round and want to ensure we can fulfill this without creating backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders.
- Retailer: I hear the Distributor mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units to avoid backlog risks, and the Factory stated they will maintain their order at 50 units anticipating higher demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the Distributor is cautious, the Factory expects a significant increase in demand. This discrepancy could lead to misalignment in our inventories. Therefore, I will continue with my order of 30 units to maintain a balance and ensure I can meet demand without creating excess inventory or backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels regularly to align our order strategies more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will continue with their order of 30 units to maintain a balance, and the Distributor mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units to avoid backlog risks. I also hear the Factory expects higher demand and plans to order 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we have varying perspectives on demand which could lead to misalignment in our inventories. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 30 units to align with the Retailer's strategy while ensuring I have sufficient stock to meet any potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we all regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our order strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned they will continue with their order of 30 units to maintain a balance amidst demand fluctuations, and the Wholesaler plans to align their order with the Retailer for similar reasons. Additionally, the Factory expects higher demand and is ordering 50 units to fulfill this without creating backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is a consensus on cautious ordering, the Factory's higher expectations could lead to potential mismatches in our inventories. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units as I believe it's prudent given my current inventory level of 36 units and the anticipated demand of 20 units next round. I suggest we all coordinate our orders closely to mitigate any inventory discrepancies.
  Proposal: I propose regular sharing of our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect within the supply chain.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [101]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "Current inventory is sufficient, but to avoid future backlog and ensure smooth operation, a conservative order is needed.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 6 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 71]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand and suggested maintaining their order quantity at 30 units to minimize backlog risks. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to align better with expected demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to ensure I remain prepared for future demand while avoiding backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose we establish regular communication regarding our demand forecasts to coordinate our order strategies effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 30 units to avoid excess inventory based on observed demand trends. I also hear the Distributor mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units for similar reasons. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our order quantities to align better with demand and avoid excess stock. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units, as I anticipate a demand of 50 units next round and want to ensure we can fulfill this without creating backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders.
- Retailer: I hear the Distributor mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units to avoid backlog risks, and the Factory stated they will maintain their order at 50 units anticipating higher demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the Distributor is cautious, the Factory expects a significant increase in demand. This discrepancy could lead to misalignment in our inventories. Therefore, I will continue with my order of 30 units to maintain a balance and ensure I can meet demand without creating excess inventory or backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels regularly to align our order strategies more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will continue with their order of 30 units to maintain a balance, and the Distributor mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units to avoid backlog risks.

--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand of 13 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand trends. I am currently managing my inventory with 97 units and maintaining a safety stock to mitigate any risks of stockouts. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to align with anticipated demand while keeping a buffer.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning order quantities with expected demand to prevent excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I am currently holding 97 units in inventory with no backlog, and I plan to order 35 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have observed a recent demand of 13 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory while still meeting demand. Therefore, I will place a larger order of 60 units to ensure I can meet the expected demand and manage any potential backlog.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on adjusting order quantities based on observed demand trends to maintain service levels while managing costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to reduce the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently hold 97 units in inventory with no backlog and plan to order 60 units this round to cover expected demand.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are adjusting their order quantity to align with anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer. I also hear Wholesaler mention they will place a larger order of 60 units to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a consensus on adjusting orders in response to recent demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to cover my expected demand of 20 units and to mitigate any potential backlog costs while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they are adjusting their order quantity to align with anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer. I also hear Wholesaler mention they will place a larger order of 60 units to meet expected demand.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).

          â€¢ Current Backlog: 30 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5
        
        Here is your recent performance log:
        Final Inventory: 36, Final Backlog: 30, Total Profit: 353.50

        Based on your performance and the desire to minimize holding & backlog costs while maximizing profits, 
        please propose any improvements to your ordering policy. 
        
        Remember:
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 6,
  "backlog": 30,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "Adjust order quantity to address backlog while considering holding costs.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are adjusting their order quantity to align with anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer. I also hear Wholesaler mention they will place a larger order of 60 units to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a consensus on adjusting orders in response to recent demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to cover my expected demand of 20 units and to mitigate any potential backlog costs while keeping my inventory levels manageable.

        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 96 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 35
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Update Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        
        Current State:
          â€¢ Current Inventory: 96 units
          â€¢ Current Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5
        
        Here is your recent performance log:
        Final Inventory: 96, Final Backlog: 0, Total Profit: 23.50

        Your current strategy is:

        Based on your performance and the desire to minimize holding & backlog costs while maximizing profits, 
        please propose any improvements to your ordering policy. 
        
        Remember:
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 61 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [106]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 66,
  "backlog": 30,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they observed a slight increase in demand and will adjust orders to maintain safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler concluded we should align orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders to manage the expected demand. Therefore, I will place a larger order to cover my current inventory issues and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better coordinate our ordering and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they observed recent demand trends suggesting a slight increase and that they will adjust their orders accordingly to maintain a safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler concluded we should align our orders to prevent stockouts while managing inventory effectively. Furthermore, the Distributor mentioned a need to coordinate to manage expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting our orders in response to observed demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 74 units to address my backlog while considering the expected demand of 50 units next round. I suggest we all regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our ordering and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to improve coordination.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said they will place a larger order this round to cover anticipated demand and mitigate backlog risk. I also hear the Distributor mentioned a need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders. Additionally, the Factory stated they will place an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting orders in response to observed demand trends, but I must be cautious of potential surplus from increased orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving my safety stock.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and reduce the risk of stockouts or surplus.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving safety stock. I also heard the Distributor express a need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders. Furthermore, the Factory mentioned they will place an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting orders in response to observed demand trends, but we must be cautious to avoid surplus from increased orders across the supply chain. Therefore, I will proceed with my order of 60 units to align with the expected demand of 30 units next round while managing my inventory effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler express a need to align their orders with expected demand, opting for an order of 60 units. Additionally, the Factory mentioned placing an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering their expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a consensus among us regarding the need to adjust orders in response to observed demand trends, but we must be wary of potential surplus from increased orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to support my current inventory challenges and anticipated demand, while still being mindful of the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and mitigate the risk of surplus or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler expressed a need to align their orders with expected demand, opting for an order of 60 units. Additionally, the Distributor mentioned placing an order of 50 units to support their inventory challenges. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is a consensus on adjusting orders, I must remain cautious about potential surplus due to higher order quantities across the supply chain. Therefore, I will proceed with my planned order of 74 units to address my current backlog while considering the anticipated demand of 50 units next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 46]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [107]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 36,
  "backlog": 30,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they observed a slight increase in demand and will adjust orders to maintain safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler concluded we should align orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders to manage the expected demand. Therefore, I will place a larger order to cover my current inventory issues and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better coordinate our ordering and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they observed recent demand trends suggesting a slight increase and that they will adjust their orders accordingly to maintain a safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler concluded we should align our orders to prevent stockouts while managing inventory effectively. Furthermore, the Distributor mentioned a need to coordinate to manage expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting our orders in response to observed demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 74 units to address my backlog while considering the expected demand of 50 units next round. I suggest we all regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our ordering and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to improve coordination.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said they will place a larger order this round to cover anticipated demand and mitigate backlog risk. I also hear the Distributor mentioned a need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders. Additionally, the Factory stated they will place an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting orders in response to observed demand trends, but I must be cautious of potential surplus from increased orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving my safety stock.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and reduce the risk of stockouts or surplus.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving safety stock. I also heard the Distributor express a need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders. Furthermore, the Factory mentioned they will place an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting orders in response to observed demand trends, but we must be cautious to avoid surplus from increased orders across the supply chain. Therefore, I will proceed with my order of 60 units to align with the expected demand of 30 units next round while managing my inventory effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler express a need to align their orders with expected demand, opting for an order of 60 units. Additionally, the Factory mentioned placing an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering their expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a consensus among us regarding the need to adjust orders in response to observed demand trends, but we must be wary of potential surplus from increased orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to support my current inventory challenges and anticipated demand, while still being mindful of the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and mitigate the risk of surplus or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler expressed a need to align their orders with expected demand, opting for an order of 60 units. Additionally, the Distributor mentioned placing an order of 50 units to support their inventory challenges. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is a consensus on adjusting orders, I must remain cautious about potential surplus due to higher order quantities across the supply chain. Therefore, I will proceed with my planned order of 74 units to address my current backlog while considering the anticipated demand of 50 units next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 29 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 106]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (29 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they observed a slight increase in demand and will adjust orders to maintain safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler concluded we should align orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders to manage the expected demand. Therefore, I will place a larger order to cover my current inventory issues and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better coordinate our ordering and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they observed recent demand trends suggesting a slight increase and that they will adjust their orders accordingly to maintain a safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler concluded we should align our orders to prevent stockouts while managing inventory effectively. Furthermore, the Distributor mentioned a need to coordinate to manage expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting our orders in response to observed demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 74 units to address my backlog while considering the expected demand of 50 units next round. I suggest we all regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our ordering and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to improve coordination.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said they will place a larger order this round to cover anticipated demand and mitigate backlog risk. I also hear the Distributor mentioned a need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders. Additionally, the Factory stated they will place an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting orders in response to observed demand trends, but I must be cautious of potential surplus from increased orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving my safety stock.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and reduce the risk of stockouts or surplus.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving safety stock. I also heard the Distributor express a need to coordinate effectively to align our inventories and orders. Furthermore, the Factory mentioned they will place an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adjusting orders in response to observed demand trends, but we must be cautious to avoid surplus from increased orders across the supply chain. Therefore, I will proceed with my order of 60 units to align with the expected demand of 30 units next round while managing my inventory effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 35 units to balance fulfilling customer needs while preserving safety stock. I also hear the Wholesaler express a need to align their orders with expected demand, opting for an order of 60 units. Additionally, the Factory mentioned placing an order of 74 units to address their backlog while considering their expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a consensus among us regarding the need to adjust orders in response to observed demand trends, but we must be wary of potential surplus from increased orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to support my current inventory challenges and anticipated demand, while still being mindful of the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and mitigate the risk of surplus or stockouts.

--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand of 13 units, which suggests a potential increase in consumer interest. However, I hear that aligning our orders closely with anticipated demand is crucial for maintaining efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should carefully coordinate our order quantities to avoid excess inventory and potential stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units this round to better align with the expected demand of 30 units while allowing for a buffer.
  Strategy Hint: Increasing order quantity to align with expected demand while managing stock levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our upcoming demand forecasts with each other to synchronize our order quantities and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 97 units in inventory and no backlog, indicating a strong position to support demand fluctuations.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 13 units and will place an order of 40 units to align with an expected demand of 30 units. This suggests a proactive approach to managing inventory, but it may also lead to excess stock if consumer interest does not sustain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 65 units to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while still managing my inventory effectively.
  Strategy Hint: Align order quantities with anticipated demand while considering current inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 97 units in inventory with no backlog, providing me with the flexibility to adjust my orders as needed.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 13 units and will place an order of 40 units to align with an expected demand of 30 units. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders closely to avoid excess stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders reflect not just anticipated demand but also inventory levels across the supply chain to minimize stockouts and excess. Therefore, I will place an order of 70 units this round to meet the expected demand of 20 units while maintaining a buffer to support fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Order quantity should balance anticipated demand with current inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a joint inventory review process to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 97 units in inventory and no backlog, positioning me well for upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 13 units and will place an order of 40 units to align with an expected demand of 30 units. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned adjusting their order to 65 units and Distributor planning to order 70 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of aligning our orders with anticipated demand while managing inventory levels. Therefore, I will place an order of 130 units to cover my backlog and expected demand, ensuring I maintain a buffer to support fluctuations while optimizing my inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Coordinate orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize stockouts and excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly check-in to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 97 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to support upcoming demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders closely to optimize inventory levels and Distributor highlighted the importance of reflecting anticipated demand while managing inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the necessity to align our orders to minimize excess stock and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 40 units this round to align with my expected demand of 30 units while keeping a buffer for fluctuations. I encourage everyone to consider their current inventory levels and anticipated demand as we place our orders.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders based on shared demand forecasts while managing inventory levels effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we create a shared document to regularly update our demand forecasts and inventory levels, fostering better coordination across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 97 units in inventory and no backlog, positioning me well to support upcoming demand without leading to excess stock.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 40 units to align with their expected demand of 30 units while keeping a buffer.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 97, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 40, Units sold: 13, Profit: 65.00, Total Profit: 16.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=40, confidence=0.85, rationale=Maintaining order to meet expected demand while avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Potential holding costs if demand decreases unexpectedly., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=97, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[13], llm_incoming=[13], llm_last_order=35
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 35
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 13 units and will place an order of 40 units to align with an expected demand of 30 units. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders closely to avoid excess stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders reflect not just anticipated demand but also inventory levels across the supply chain to minimize stockouts and excess. Therefore, I will place an order of 70 units this round to meet the expected demand of 20 units while maintaining a buffer to support fluctuations.

I also note that Distributor emphasized the need to balance anticipated demand with current inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our order quantities more effectively to avoid excess stock and stockouts.

          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 80
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

This suggests a proactive approach to managing inventory, but it may also lead to excess stock if consumer interest does not sustain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Update Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        
        Current State:
          â€¢ Current Inventory: 0 units
          â€¢ Current Backlog: 79 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5
        
        Here is your recent performance log:
        Final Inventory: 0, Final Backlog: 79, Total Profit: 508.00

        Your current strategy is:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 6,
  "backlog": 30,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "Adjust order quantity to address backlog while considering holding costs.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential for increased backlog if demand exceeds expectations; however, lowering order quantity reduces holding costs.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 50,
  "order_quantity": 74
}

        Based on your performance and the desire to minimize holding & backlog costs while maximizing profits, 
        please propose any improvements to your ordering policy. 
        
        Remember:
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
