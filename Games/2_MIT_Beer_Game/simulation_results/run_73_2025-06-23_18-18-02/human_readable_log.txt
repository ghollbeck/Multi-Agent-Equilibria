Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 101, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 40, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=40, confidence=0.85, rationale=To prevent stockouts, I will order to meet expected demand while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Potential for excess inventory or backlog due to demand fluctuations., expected_demand_next_round=40, llm_inventory=101, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9], llm_incoming=[9], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Additionally, I noticed the Factory proposed weekly coordination calls for updating demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to collaborate more closely to ensure our forecasts are aligned and to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we finalize our weekly coordination call schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring that we make informed decisions moving forward.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly coordination call to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we are all aligned.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer suggested we all confirm our forecasts to optimize inventory management and that they expect a demand of 50 units next round. The Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders and mentioned an expected demand of 40 units, while the Distributor also highlighted the need for proactive communication and expects a demand of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts closely to avoid overstock and stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to advocate for our proposed weekly coordination calls to ensure we all share our demand expectations and inventory levels, which will help us make informed decisions moving forward.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will order 50 units to cover expected demand while keeping a buffer to ensure service levels.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on aligning my orders with expected demand to minimize stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the upcoming rounds to align our orders and optimize inventory levels across the supply chain.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 22 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [111]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "Maintaining a sufficient inventory while accounting for potential demand fluctuations to avoid stockouts and backlog costs.",

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 8 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 89]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned that they are expecting a demand increase in the upcoming rounds. This is important as it may lead to higher orders from us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 50 units to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while managing my inventory effectively.
  Strategy Hint: Order to cover expected demand, while being cautious of excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units of inventory and no backlog, but I anticipate a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they anticipate a demand of 50 units next round and are maintaining their current order strategy to ensure enough stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain cautious about inventory levels to prevent stockouts while being mindful of excess stock. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to align with the expected demand of 40 units, keeping my inventory stable and ready to meet the needs of the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Balance inventory levels with expected demand to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to reduce fluctuations and avoid stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 14 units of inventory and no backlog, while planning an order of 40 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they anticipate a demand of 50 units next round and are maintaining their current order strategy to ensure enough stock. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned adjusting their order quantity to align with the expected demand of 40 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious and align our orders to prevent stockouts while managing our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order strategy of 20 units to cover my backlog while being mindful of the demand signals from both of you.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain order quantities that align with expected demand while addressing backlog issues.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's commit to sharing our demand forecasts more frequently to coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units of inventory and a backlog of 66 units, with a total profit of $484.50 so far.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they anticipate a demand of 50 units next round and will maintain an order strategy of 50 units. I also heard the Wholesaler mention adjusting their order to align with expected demand of 40 units, and the Distributor is maintaining a strategy of 20 units to cover backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about our orders to prevent stockouts while being mindful of excess stock. Therefore, I will order 50 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, while still maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: Order to meet backlog while aligning with expected demand to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our order quantities ahead of time to better align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units of inventory and a backlog of 9 units, with total profit of $774.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Distributor said they are maintaining their order strategy of 20 units to cover their backlog while monitoring our demand signals. Additionally, the Factory mentioned they will order 50 units to cover their backlog and align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our order quantities to avoid stockouts but also manage our inventory levels effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning order quantities with expected demand while managing inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our updated inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to improve coordination and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units of inventory and no backlog, but I anticipate a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they anticipate a demand of 50 units next round and are maintaining their order strategy of 50 units to ensure enough stock. I also heard the Distributor mention they will maintain their order of 20 units to cover their backlog while being mindful of demand signals. Additionally, the Factory plans to order 50 units to cover their backlog and align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about our order quantities to avoid stockouts while managing inventory levels effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 40 units to ensure I can meet the expected demand without risking excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Balance inventory levels with expected demand to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our order strategies and reduce fluctuations.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 14 units of inventory and no backlog, while planning an order of 40 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they anticipate a demand of 50 units next round and are maintaining their order strategy of 50 units to ensure enough stock. I also heard the Wholesaler mention they will maintain their order of 40 units to meet expected demand, and the Factory will order 50 units to align with anticipated demand while covering their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to remain cautious about our order quantities to prevent stockouts and manage our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order strategy of 20 units to address my backlog while staying in tune with the demand signals from all of you.
  Strategy Hint: Align order quantities with anticipated demand while addressing backlog issues.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's commit to sharing our demand forecasts regularly to coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units of inventory and a backlog of 66 units, with a total profit of $484.50 so far.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order of 50 units to meet anticipated demand while managing inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler will keep their order at 40 units to avoid excess inventory, and the Distributor will maintain their order of 20 units to address backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our order quantities to prevent stockouts while considering our inventory levels. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, ensuring I maintain a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: Order to meet backlog while aligning with expected demand to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we synchronize our order quantities based on real-time demand forecasts to mitigate fluctuations and manage inventory effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units of inventory and a backlog of 9 units, with total profit of $774.00 so far.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 104, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 50, Units sold: 7, Profit: 35.00, Total Profit: -28.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=50, confidence=0.85, rationale=To cover expected demand and maintain a buffer to avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Potential for excess inventory if demand decreases significantly., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=104, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 9, 7], llm_incoming=[57], llm_last_order=50
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [57]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Update Output: {}
    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 66 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 49, 57]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (66 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "Maintaining a sufficient inventory while accounting for potential demand fluctuations to avoid stockouts and backlog costs.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 9 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 89, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 58
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (9 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

--------------------- Round 4 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [49, 89, 111, 58]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that our recent demand has shown variability, with fluctuations ranging from 7 to 11 units. This could indicate shifting consumer preferences or seasonal changes. I hear that maintaining service levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our ordering strategies to better match demand and prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to ensure that I can meet the expected demand in the next round while keeping my inventory levels in check.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with observed demand trends to minimize excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our weekly demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My current inventory stands at 142 units with no backlog, and I expect a demand of about 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that our recent demand has shown variability, indicating shifting consumer preferences and the need for coordinated strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order for 40 units to ensure I can meet the expected demand while maintaining a stable inventory for the next round.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with demand trends to optimize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication channel to share weekly demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 42 units, and I anticipate a demand of 40 units in the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining service levels is crucial for all of us, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordinated strategies to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face similar challenges with demand variability, which emphasizes the importance of aligning our order quantities and forecasts.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 142 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [61]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 66 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [49, 57, 61]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [58]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 66
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (66 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 128 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [89, 31, 111]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 59
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (128 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 5 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [57, 31, 50, 59]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for timely orders to maintain flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to ensure we can meet upcoming demand without causing delays. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to cover expected demand and maintain adequate service levels, while reducing the risk of stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: Focusing on accurate demand forecasting to minimize excess inventory and backlogs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to better synchronize our orders.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 193 units in inventory and have observed a recent demand trend averaging around 8 units per round. My total profit so far is negative, indicating a need for better alignment.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for timely orders to maintain flow and a focus on accurate demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we can enhance our coordination to better align our orders and minimize the risk of stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units this round, as I anticipate steady demand and wish to keep inventory levels stable.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain alignment in order quantities to match demand trends and reduce excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us optimize our orders collectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 37 units in inventory and observed recent demand averaging around 8 units per round, with no backlogs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should align our order quantities to ensure timely fulfillment and avoid stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining order quantities to match demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to avoid stockouts, my current backlog of 92 units suggests that immediate action is necessary to meet demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 92 units this round to address the backlog and prepare for future demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on timely order placements to eliminate backlog while considering future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share real-time demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all synchronize our orders effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 92 units, indicating the need for an immediate order to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should align our order quantities to ensure timely fulfillment and avoid stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining order quantities to match demand trends. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the need for immediate action due to their backlog of 92 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of timely orders to manage our inventory effectively. However, my current backlog of 185 units indicates a significant need to catch up on orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to address my backlog while also considering the expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: Coordination on order quantities can help minimize excess inventory and backlogs for all agents.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's implement a shared platform for regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels to synchronize our orders effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have no inventory and a backlog of 185 units, which necessitates immediate action to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Distributor mentioned their backlog of 92 units, indicating a pressing need for timely orders to meet demand. Additionally, the Factory highlighted their backlog of 185 units, emphasizing the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to address both the immediate backlog and the expected demand trends. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units this round, aiming to cover my expected demand while also supporting the overall supply chain flow.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts can minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared communication platform to regularly update each other on demand forecasts and inventory levels, helping to synchronize our orders and manage backlogs effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 193 units in inventory and have observed a recent demand trend averaging around 8 units per round, indicating a stable demand environment.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need to align our order quantities to address both immediate backlog and expected demand trends. Additionally, I note the Distributor's significant backlog of 92 units and the Factory's backlog of 185 units, reflecting a pressing need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication and synchronize our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units this round, as I anticipate steady demand and want to keep my inventory levels manageable while supporting the overall flow.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on synchronized order quantities to minimize stockouts and backlogs across the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's implement a shared platform for regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all optimize our orders collectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 37 units in inventory and have observed recent demand averaging around 8 units per round, with no backlogs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we must align our order quantities to address both immediate backlog and expected demand trends. Additionally, I note the Wholesaler's emphasis on effective coordination and maintaining order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the pressing need to synchronize our orders to mitigate backlogs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 92 units this round to address my current backlog and prepare for future demand fluctuations while encouraging everyone to consider their own order quantities carefully to support overall flow.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on synchronized orders to minimize backlogs and ensure timely fulfillment across the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's implement a shared communication platform to regularly update each other on demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all optimize our orders collectively.

Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need to align our order quantities to address both immediate backlog and expected demand trends. Additionally, I note the Wholesaler's emphasis on effective coordination and maintaining order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the pressing need to synchronize our orders to mitigate backlogs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units this round to address my backlog while also considering the expected demand of 50 units.
  Strategy Hint: Coordination on order quantities can help minimize excess inventory and backlogs for all agents.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's implement a shared platform for regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels to synchronize our orders effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have no inventory and a backlog of 185 units, which necessitates immediate action to meet demand.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 193, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 6, Profit: 30.00, Total Profit: -111.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.85, rationale=To maintain service levels and avoid stockouts, I will order enough to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to excess inventory or backlogs, impacting costs., expected_demand_next_round=24, llm_inventory=193, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[7, 11, 6], llm_incoming=[36], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 193 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 92 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [57, 61, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [59]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 66
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (92 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "Maintaining a sufficient inventory while accounting for potential demand fluctuations to avoid stockouts and backlog costs.",
  "risk_assessment": "Possible fluctuations in demand may lead to overstock or stockouts if not carefully managed.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 185 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 111, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 178
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (185 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should align our order quantities to ensure timely fulfillment and avoid stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining order quantities to match demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to avoid stockouts, my current backlog of 92 units suggests that immediate action is necessary to meet demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 92 units this round to address the backlog and prepare for future demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share real-time demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all synchronize our orders effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should align our order quantities to ensure timely fulfillment and avoid stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining order quantities to match demand trends. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the need for immediate action due to their backlog of 92 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of timely orders to manage our inventory effectively. However, my current backlog of 185 units indicates a significant need to catch up on orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to address my backlog while also considering the expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's implement a shared platform for regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels to synchronize our orders effectively.
- Retailer: I hear the Distributor mentioned their backlog of 92 units, indicating a pressing need for timely orders to meet demand. Additionally, the Factory highlighted their backlog of 185 units, emphasizing the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to address both the immediate backlog and the expected demand trends. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units this round, aiming to cover my expected demand while also supporting the overall supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared communication platform to regularly update each other on demand forecasts and inventory levels, helping to synchronize our orders and manage backlogs effectively.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need to align our order quantities to address both immediate backlog and expected demand trends. Additionally, I note the Distributor's significant backlog of 92 units and the Factory's backlog of 185 units, reflecting a pressing need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication and synchronize our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units this round, as I anticipate steady demand and want to keep my inventory levels manageable while supporting the overall flow.
  Proposal: Let's implement a shared platform for regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all optimize our orders collectively.

--------------------- Round 6 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [61, 111, 58, 178]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned fluctuations in demand which could impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate more consistently about our demand forecasts to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to ensure we can meet expected demand while maintaining a healthy inventory level.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand to maintain service levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 246 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand patterns averaging around 8-11 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of consistent communication about demand forecasts to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our orders and sharing insights can help optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to maintain my inventory of 110 units while placing an order of 40 to meet the anticipated demand and ensure we all have enough stock to satisfy customer needs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders based on shared demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we hold regular meetings to discuss our demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to coordinate our orders more effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 110 units in inventory and a stable backlog of 0, with recent demand averaging around 8-11 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate more consistently about our demand forecasts to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that effective communication and collaboration will be key to optimizing our inventory levels across the chain, especially given my current backlog of 112 units and zero inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we hold a brief meeting to coordinate our expected demand and order quantities to minimize the bullwhip effect and align our actions.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to coordinate closely with all agents to align orders and manage inventory effectively.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 246 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 6, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our recent demand patterns and coordinate our orders more effectively to minimize excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to align with the expected demand of 50 and address my current backlog of 157 units.
  Proposal: I propose we establish regular meetings to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we can respond effectively to fluctuations in demand.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 112 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [61, 36, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [178]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 92
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (112 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 157 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [111, 50, 58]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 235
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (157 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [36, 50, 59, 235]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed the recent demand patterns showing an increase, with orders of 6, 8, and 8 units. This indicates a potential upward trend in demand for the next rounds. I hear that the Wholesaler is concerned about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate to avoid excess stock while meeting demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better align with the expected demand and maintain service levels.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my current inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 274 units in inventory and no backlog, while my expected demand for the next round is 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they observed an increase in demand with recent orders of 6, 8, and 8 units, indicating a potential upward trend. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand patterns and align our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 40 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance inventory with demand to minimize costs and avoid excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular communication about our inventory levels and demand forecasts to optimize our ordering strategy and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 122 units in inventory and no backlog, with an expected demand for the next round of 40 units.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 274 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our efforts closely to ensure we effectively meet the increasing demand without contributing to excess inventory or backlogs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our ordering strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 131 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 38, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [235]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 192
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (131 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 173 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [50, 58, 59]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 207
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (173 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "To minimize costs, I will order enough to cover potential demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they observed an increase in demand with recent orders of 6, 8, and 8 units, indicating a potential upward trend. I also note the Wholesaler is maintaining their order quantity of 40 units to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our strategies to manage inventory effectively and meet the increasing demand while avoiding stockouts. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 20 units in order to maintain a balance between meeting demand and managing my backlog of 131 units.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to coordinate our order quantities and minimize the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 303, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 25, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -397.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=25, confidence=0.85, rationale=To cover expected demand and maintain a buffer to prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=Fluctuations in demand could lead to either excess inventory or backlogs., expected_demand_next_round=25, llm_inventory=303, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8, 8, 9], llm_incoming=[39], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 303 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 32 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [38, 38, 39]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [207]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 192
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (32 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 336 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [58, 59, 178]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 223
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (336 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 9 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [38, 59, 235, 223]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that our recent demand has been stable around 8 to 9 units. This suggests a consistent need, but fluctuations could impact our inventory levels. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely to adjust orders accordingly.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory turnover to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 333 units in inventory, and I expect demand to be around 50 units next round. This gives us a buffer to manage any unexpected changes.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned that recent demand has been stable around 8 to 9 units and that they expect demand to be around 50 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for potential fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory levels and order quantity to ensure I can meet expected demand while minimizing costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will continue to monitor inventory closely and order based on demand forecasts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 167 units in inventory, and my last order was 40 units, anticipating stable demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they expect demand to be around 50 units next round and that they are closely monitoring inventory turnover to minimize costs. I also hear the Wholesaler agreeing with the Retailer on maintaining inventory levels to prepare for potential fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a balanced inventory while considering the lower demand forecast I have observed.
  Strategy Hint: My approach is to strategically order based on observed demand trends while maintaining inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update on our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 130 units in inventory, and my recent demand has been fluctuating between 33 and 39 units. I expect lower demand of around 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they expect demand to be around 50 units next round, and the Wholesaler is maintaining inventory levels to prepare for fluctuations. Additionally, the Distributor mentioned a lower demand of around 20 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all have varying expectations of demand, which could lead to misalignment in our orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to cover potential demand while addressing my backlog of 289 units.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on collective demand forecasts to minimize stockouts and backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we schedule weekly updates to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 289 units, indicating a critical need to fulfill outstanding orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned their intention to maintain current inventory levels and order quantities, while the Distributor plans to order 20 units based on lower demand expectations. Additionally, the Factory is addressing a significant backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will monitor our current inventory levels and adjust my upcoming order to better match the anticipated demand of 50 units next round, while also proposing that we all share our updated forecasts regularly to minimize discrepancies.
  Strategy Hint: I will adjust my orders based on collective insights to optimize inventory levels and minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to coordinate orders effectively and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 333 units in inventory and expect demand to be around 50 units next round, providing a buffer for unexpected changes.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned their expectation of demand around 50 units next round and their intention to adjust orders accordingly. I also heard the Distributor plan to order 20 units based on lower demand observations, and the Factory is addressing a significant backlog with an order of 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders more closely to align with the anticipated demand and avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 40 units to be in line with the expected demand while ensuring I can fulfill needs without incurring excess cost.
  Strategy Hint: I will continue to monitor demand and adjust my orders strategically to meet forecasted needs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing updated demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us all align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 167 units in inventory, and my last order was 40 units, anticipating stable demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned they will adjust their orders to better match the anticipated demand of 50 units next round. I also heard the Wholesaler committing to maintain their order quantity of 40 units to align with expected demand. Additionally, the Factory is addressing a significant backlog with an order of 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a collective recognition of the importance of aligning our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units for this round, considering my current inventory of 130 units and the lower demand forecast I have observed.
  Strategy Hint: My approach is to strategically order while considering the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our updated demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 333, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 50, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -524.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=50, confidence=0.85, rationale=To ensure sufficient inventory and prevent stockouts, I will order based on expected demand and current inventory., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to excess inventory or unmet demand, impacting costs., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=333, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8, 9, 8], llm_incoming=[33], llm_last_order=25
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 333 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 130 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [38, 39, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [223]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 71
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "Maintaining a sufficient inventory while accounting for potential demand fluctuations to avoid stockouts and backlog costs.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they expect demand to be around 50 units next round and that they are closely monitoring inventory turnover to minimize costs. I also hear the Wholesaler agreeing with the Retailer on maintaining inventory levels to prepare for potential fluctuations in demand.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game.

          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 289 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [59, 178, 105]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 400
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (289 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they expect demand to be around 50 units next round and that they are closely monitoring inventory turnover to minimize costs. I also hear the Wholesaler agreeing with the Retailer on maintaining inventory levels to prepare for potential fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a balanced inventory while considering the lower demand forecast I have observed.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update on our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they expect demand to be around 50 units next round, and the Wholesaler is maintaining inventory levels to prepare for fluctuations. Additionally, the Distributor mentioned a lower demand of around 20 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all have varying expectations of demand, which could lead to misalignment in our orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to cover potential demand while addressing my backlog of 289 units.
  Proposal: I propose that we schedule weekly updates to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned their intention to maintain current inventory levels and order quantities, while the Distributor plans to order 20 units based on lower demand expectations. Additionally, the Factory is addressing a significant backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will monitor our current inventory levels and adjust my upcoming order to better match the anticipated demand of 50 units next round, while also proposing that we all share our updated forecasts regularly to minimize discrepancies.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 9, 8, and 15 units. This indicates a potential trend of increasing demand. I believe it's important for all of us to coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with the expected demand of 50 units for this round while maintaining my current inventory of 357 units.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance between meeting demand and minimizing excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand estimates for the next rounds to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 357, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 50, Units sold: 15, Profit: 75.00, Total Profit: -627.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=50, confidence=0.85, rationale=I will order 50 units to cover expected demand and maintain inventory buffer., risk_assessment=Potential for excess inventory if demand decreases unexpectedly., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=357, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 8, 15], llm_incoming=[65], llm_last_order=50
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 357 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [65]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are adjusting their order to align with an expected demand of 50 units due to observed fluctuations. I also hear Wholesaler plans to place an order of 40 units to prepare for this increased demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing a trend of rising demand and the need for better coordination. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units this round to balance my stock with the expected demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let’s establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to ensure we align our orders better.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with the expected demand of 50 units while maintaining an inventory of 357 units. I also hear Wholesaler plans to place an order of 40 units in response to the demand trend, and Distributor will place an order of 20 units to balance their stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing a trend of rising demand and the importance of coordination. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to address my backlog of 34 units and align with the expected demand, while also ensuring I maintain a buffer to avoid future stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we create a shared platform for communicating our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to enhance our alignment and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said they will place an order of 40 units to prepare for the expected demand, and the Distributor mentioned they will order 20 units to balance their stock. I also noted the Factory plans to order 50 units to address their backlog and align with demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the trend of rising demand and the need for coordination in our ordering.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 232 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [39, 33, 65]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [400]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Update Output: {}
    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 34 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [178, 105, 105]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 400
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (34 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "To minimize costs, I will order enough to cover potential demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are adjusting their order to align with an expected demand of 50 units due to observed fluctuations. I also hear Wholesaler plans to place an order of 40 units to prepare for this increased demand.

Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to address my backlog and align with the expected demand while ensuring I do not overcommit.", "strategy_hint": "I aim to balance my backlog while coordinating with the expected demand.", "collaboration_proposal": "I propose we establish a shared platform for ongoing communication of our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination and minimize the bullwhip effect.", "information_shared": "Currently, I have a backlog of 34 units and no inventory, with my last order being 400 units.", "confidence": 0.8}

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 100,
          "backlog": 0,
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,
          "rationale": "<brief explanation of your reasoning>",
          "risk_assessment": "<describe any risks you anticipate>",
          "expected_demand_next_round": <integer>,
          "order_quantity": <integer>
        }

        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no markdown, no triple backticks, no code fences, and do NOT write the word 'json' anywhere. Your reply must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else. If you include anything else, your answer will be rejected. KEEP IT RATHER SHORT
