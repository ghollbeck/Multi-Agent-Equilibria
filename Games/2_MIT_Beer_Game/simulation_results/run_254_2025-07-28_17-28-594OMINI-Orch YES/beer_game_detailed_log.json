My general ordering approach is to maintain a buffer to avoid stockouts while being mindful of holding costs. Therefore, I plan to order 10 units this round to ensure I can meet potential demand spikes while keeping my inventory at a manageable level. I suggest we aim for a collective target of maintaining enough inventory to cover at least 3 rounds of expected demand across the supply chain.

Therefore, I plan to order 10 units this round to ensure I can meet expected demand and maintain a healthy inventory level. I propose that we all aim to keep our inventories at a level that can cover at least 3 rounds of expected demand, which would be around 30 units for each of us.

Therefore, I plan to order 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and maintain a healthy inventory level. I suggest that we coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock to meet the average demand, aiming for a target of 10-12 units across the chain.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure that our production aligns with the anticipated demand to avoid stockouts. My current inventory is 0 units and I have a backlog of 2 units. Last round, I made a profit of 50.0. My general ordering approach is to produce enough to cover the backlog and maintain a buffer for future demand.
