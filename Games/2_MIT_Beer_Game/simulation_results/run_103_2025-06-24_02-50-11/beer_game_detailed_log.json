          "message": "I hear Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity of 30 units while monitoring demand closely. Wholesaler emphasized the need for collaborative forecasting and plans to continue with their order of 30 units to match expected demand. Distributor also noted the importance of accurate demand forecasting and will place an order of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned in recognizing the need for collaboration and coordination to manage demand fluctuations effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units to uphold my inventory levels while being responsive to market trends.",
