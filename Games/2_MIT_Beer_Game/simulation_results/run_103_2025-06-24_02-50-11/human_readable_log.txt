--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous communications from other agents, but I want to highlight that my recent order reflects an expected demand of 30 units in the next round. Given my current inventory of 99 units, I aim to avoid stockouts while managing overall supply chain efficiency.
  Strategy Hint: I'm focusing on aligning orders with expected demand to maintain optimal inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and no backlog, which should provide some flexibility in responding to demand fluctuations.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they aim to avoid stockouts while managing overall supply chain efficiency, expecting a demand of 30 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that coordinating our orders can help us minimize risks of overstock and stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units to align with the anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer in my inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover both current inventory and expected demand while being mindful of potential fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand forecasts regularly to enhance order alignment and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and will be placing an order for 30 units to meet anticipated demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they expect a demand of 30 units next round and aim to avoid stockouts. I also hear Wholesaler plans to order 30 units to align with this anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning our orders around similar expectations, which is positive for reducing the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to cover the expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory to avoid stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a balance between meeting expected demand and avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule to share our demand forecasts to improve our order alignment and minimize fluctuations.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 99, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=To meet expected demand and maintain a buffer, I will order 30 units., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could lead to excess inventory or stockouts if not managed., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=99, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

However, I believe that with my current inventory of 99 units and no backlog, I can afford to place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain flexibility while anticipating future demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to balance my inventory and meet expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our expected demand forecasts to enhance order alignment across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler said they will place an order for 30 units to align with anticipated demand, and Distributor mentioned they will order 20 units while maintaining inventory balance. Factory also plans to order 20 units, which reflects a similar alignment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all responding to a shared understanding of demand, which is positive.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that

    LLM Update Output: {}
    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will order to cover expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable initial inventory and no backlog, I can afford to place a moderate order to maintain inventory levels while anticipating future demand.",

External demand (Retailer): 5
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining consistent inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better match the observed demand patterns. Therefore, I will continue to place an order of 30 units in anticipation of demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to ensure we are not overstocked.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with observed demand to minimize excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our ordering schedules to reduce fluctuations and stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 104 units in inventory and have observed recent demand at 11 and 5 units, suggesting that we may need to prepare for a potential increase in demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that we should align our orders to better match observed demand patterns and coordinate our ordering schedules to reduce fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a balanced inventory is essential for all of us. Therefore, I will continue to place an order of 30 units, as I anticipate demand to remain steady around this figure while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain alignment with observed demand while managing inventory levels.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler said maintaining a balanced inventory is essential for all of us, and the Distributor emphasized the need to coordinate orders to avoid excess stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our inventory levels and align our orders more precisely to the demand patterns we are observing. Therefore, I will continue to place an order of 30 units, as I anticipate demand to remain consistent with recent trends while keeping an eye on potential future fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with observed demand while maintaining adequate inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts weekly to better synchronize our ordering approach and minimize excess.
  Information Shared: I currently have 104 units in inventory and have observed recent demand at 11 and 5 units, indicating we should be prepared for potential increases in demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our inventory levels and align our orders more precisely to the demand patterns we are observing. I also note that the Distributor emphasized the need to coordinate orders to avoid excess stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a balanced inventory is critical for all of us, especially given the recent demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will continue to place an order of 30 units to ensure we meet expected demand while avoiding potential stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with observed demand and maintaining inventory balance.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts to better align our orders and minimize excess.
  Information Shared: I currently have 74 units in inventory and have observed recent demand at 11 and 5 units, with an expected demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our inventory levels and align our orders more precisely to the demand patterns we are observing. I also note the Wholesaler emphasized maintaining a balanced inventory, which resonates with my strategy. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about over-ordering given the recent demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to align with the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with expected demand while avoiding overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular schedule for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts, so we can synchronize our ordering approaches more effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 44 units in inventory and have noted recent demand spikes of 11 and 35 units, indicating variability that we should prepare for.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our inventory levels and align our orders more precisely to the demand patterns we are observing, and the Wholesaler emphasized maintaining a balanced inventory. I also note that the Distributor is adjusting their order to 20 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory while still ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain my inventory levels and prepare for the expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on cautious ordering to balance inventory without overstocking.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 14 units in inventory and have noticed recent demand fluctuations that suggest a cautious approach to ordering.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 104, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 5, Profit: 25.00, Total Profit: -21.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=I will order 30 units to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer to avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could lead to stockouts or overstock if not monitored closely., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=104, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 5], llm_incoming=[35], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid excess stock while preparing for potential demand increases. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with the expected demand and maintain adequate inventory without overstocking.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should align our orders to better match observed demand patterns and maintain consistent inventory levels. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to order 30 units while the Distributor aims for 20. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering as it could lead to excess inventory if demand does not meet our expectations. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain adequate inventory levels while anticipating the expected demand of 20 units next round.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 44 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 35]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [95]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will order to cover expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 14 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 65]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [65]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should align our orders to better match observed demand patterns and monitor inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of maintaining balanced inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid excess stock while preparing for potential demand increases. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with the expected demand and maintain adequate inventory without overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's establish regular communication of our inventory levels and demand forecasts to synchronize our ordering approach.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should align our orders to better match observed demand patterns and maintain consistent inventory levels. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to order 30 units while the Distributor aims for 20. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering as it could lead to excess inventory if demand does not meet our expectations. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain adequate inventory levels while anticipating the expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts to better align our orders.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said maintaining a balanced inventory is essential for all of us, and the Distributor emphasized the need to coordinate orders to avoid excess stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our inventory levels and align our orders more precisely to the demand patterns we are observing. Therefore, I will continue to place an order of 30 units, as I anticipate demand to remain consistent with recent trends while keeping an eye on potential future fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts weekly to better synchronize our ordering approach and minimize excess.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a decrease in demand fluctuations recently. This may lead to a more stable ordering pattern. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should synchronize our orders to avoid unnecessary stockpiling. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 30 units while keeping an eye on the inventory levels to ensure we don't overstock.
  Strategy Hint: Monitor demand closely while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our inventory levels and expected demand projections regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units in inventory and no backlog, with an expected demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a decrease in demand fluctuations, leading to a more stable ordering pattern. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stockpiling. Therefore, I will continue to order 30 units to align with this stable demand while ensuring we have enough inventory to meet it.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain stable inventory levels to match expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to further minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 44 units in inventory and no backlog, with an anticipated demand of 30 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should synchronize our orders to avoid unnecessary stockpiling, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about coordinating orders for a stable inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders closely to maintain optimal inventory levels and meet expected demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover my backlog while anticipating the expected demand next round, and I encourage you to adjust your orders accordingly to avoid excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders to manage inventory levels effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and expected demand projections regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, with an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should synchronize orders to avoid unnecessary stockpiling, and the Wholesaler mentioned continuing to order 30 units to align with stable demand patterns. The Distributor emphasized aligning orders closely to maintain optimal inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that while I recognize the call for coordination, my current backlog of 20 units requires immediate attention. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to address my backlog while also preparing for the anticipated demand next round.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on addressing backlog while considering future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our order quantities and any changes in demand forecasts regularly to ensure we are aligned and minimize excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, with an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Distributor emphasized aligning orders closely to maintain optimal inventory levels, and the Factory pointed out their current backlog of 20 units requiring immediate attention. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to stabilize our inventory, we must be mindful of the Factory's need to address their backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 30 units to meet the expected demand while monitoring my inventory levels closely to avoid overstocking.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on synchronized orders while being responsive to others' inventory needs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and order quantities to better align our strategies and minimize excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units in inventory, no backlog, and an expected demand of 30 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 30 units to meet expected demand while monitoring for overstock. The Distributor emphasized aligning orders closely to manage inventory levels effectively, and the Factory pointed out their need to address a backlog of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to stabilize our inventory, we must be careful to synchronize our orders to avoid excess and ensure the Factory can fulfill its backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 30 units to align with the expected demand and ensure we have sufficient inventory without risking overstock.
  Strategy Hint: Let's synchronize our orders to balance inventory and meet demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and anticipated demand forecasts consistently to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 44 units in inventory and no backlog, with an anticipated demand of 30 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 30 units to meet expected demand while monitoring for overstock, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by also maintaining their order of 30 units. The Factory pointed out their backlog of 20 units requiring immediate attention. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for synchronization to avoid excess inventory while addressing backlogs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, but I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely for the next rounds to prevent any stockouts or overstock situations.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders to manage inventory effectively while addressing backlogs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and anticipated demand forecasts regularly to ensure we are aligned and minimize excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, with an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 30 units to meet expected demand while monitoring for overstock, and the Wholesaler also stated they will maintain their order of 30 units to align with this demand. The Distributor noted their backlog and adjusted their order to 20 units to cover it. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all recognize the need for synchronization, my current backlog of 20 units still requires immediate attention. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to meet my backlog and will monitor future demands closely to avoid overstock.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders while addressing immediate backlog needs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and expected demand forecasts regularly to minimize excess inventory and better align our strategies.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, with an expected demand of 20 units next round.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 104, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: -18.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=I will order to cover expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to either excess inventory or backlog if not managed carefully., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=104, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 5, 11], llm_incoming=[41], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 5, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to stabilize our inventory, we must be mindful of the Factory's need to address their backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 30 units to meet the expected demand while monitoring my inventory levels closely to avoid overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and order quantities to better align our strategies and minimize excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 30 units to meet expected demand while monitoring for overstock. The Distributor emphasized aligning orders closely to manage inventory levels effectively, and the Factory pointed out their need to address a backlog of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to stabilize our inventory, we must be careful to synchronize our orders to avoid excess and ensure the Factory can fulfill its backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 30 units to align with the expected demand and ensure we have sufficient inventory without risking overstock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and anticipated demand forecasts consistently to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 30 units to meet expected demand while monitoring for overstock, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by also maintaining their order of 30 units. The Factory pointed out their backlog of 20 units requiring immediate attention. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for synchronization to avoid excess inventory while addressing backlogs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, but I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely for the next rounds to prevent any stockouts or overstock situations.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 30 units to meet expected demand while monitoring for overstock, and the Wholesaler also stated they will maintain their order of 30 units to align with this demand. The Distributor noted their backlog and adjusted their order to 20 units to cover it. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all recognize the need for synchronization, my current backlog of 20 units still requires immediate attention. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to meet my backlog and will monitor future demands closely to avoid overstock.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 35, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [55]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will order to cover expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 65, 55]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [75]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable initial inventory and no backlog, I can afford to place a moderate order to maintain inventory levels while anticipating future demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should synchronize our orders to avoid unnecessary stockpiling, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about coordinating orders for a stable inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders closely to maintain optimal inventory levels and meet expected demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover my backlog while anticipating the expected demand next round, and I encourage you to adjust your orders accordingly to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and expected demand projections regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should synchronize orders to avoid unnecessary stockpiling, and the Wholesaler mentioned continuing to order 30 units to align with stable demand patterns. The Distributor emphasized aligning orders closely to maintain optimal inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that while I recognize the call for coordination, my current backlog of 20 units requires immediate attention. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to address my backlog while also preparing for the anticipated demand next round.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our order quantities and any changes in demand forecasts regularly to ensure we are aligned and minimize excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear the Distributor emphasized aligning orders closely to maintain optimal inventory levels, and the Factory pointed out their current backlog of 20 units requiring immediate attention. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to stabilize our inventory, we must be mindful of the Factory's need to address their backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 30 units to meet the expected demand while monitoring my inventory levels closely to avoid overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and order quantities to better align our strategies and minimize excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 30 units to meet expected demand while monitoring for overstock. The Distributor emphasized aligning orders closely to manage inventory levels effectively, and the Factory pointed out their need to address a backlog of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to stabilize our inventory, we must be careful to synchronize our orders to avoid excess and ensure the Factory can fulfill its backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 30 units to align with the expected demand and ensure we have sufficient inventory without risking overstock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and anticipated demand forecasts consistently to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.

  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and anticipated demand forecasts regularly to ensure we are aligned and minimize excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 30 units to meet expected demand while monitoring for overstock, and the Wholesaler also stated they will maintain their order of 30 units to align with this demand. The Distributor noted their backlog and adjusted their order to 20 units to cover it. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all recognize the need for synchronization, my current backlog of 20 units still requires immediate attention. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to meet my backlog and will monitor future demands closely to avoid overstock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and expected demand forecasts regularly to minimize excess inventory and better align our strategies.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 128, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: -27.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=I must meet the anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, potentially leading to excess inventory or backlog if not managed carefully., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=128, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[5, 11, 11], llm_incoming=[41], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 128 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should be prepared for higher demand and maintain a strategy of 30 units to avoid stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for careful order coordination due to potential upward demand shifts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be vigilant in monitoring demand patterns and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent excess backlog and stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory to cover expected demand while maintaining flexibility for future rounds.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a bi-weekly meeting to align our demand forecasts and inventory levels, improving our collective order strategies.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should adjust our orders for higher demand, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern for careful order coordination. Additionally, the Distributor mentioned maintaining a strategy of 30 units to cover expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be aligned on order quantities to manage the anticipated increase in demand effectively. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to mitigate my backlog while being cautious not to overextend my capacity.
  Proposal: I propose we set up a weekly communication channel to discuss order quantities and demand forecasts, enhancing our coordination.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 8 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [35, 41, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [85]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will order to cover expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 52 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [65, 55, 87]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [139]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 65
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (52 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

--------------------- Round 5 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [41, 55, 55, 140]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that communication between agents is crucial for optimizing our supply chain. Given my current inventory of 162 units and the recent demand of 11, 11, and 7, I believe we need to ensure that our orders reflect actual demand trends to prevent excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities more closely with expected demand, which for me is projected at 30 units next round. Therefore, I will place an order of 30 units to maintain balance.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders closely with actual demand to minimize fluctuations.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 162, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 7, Profit: 35.00, Total Profit: -73.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=I have sufficient inventory and expect demand to stay consistent, so I will order to maintain a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, potentially leading to excess inventory if overestimated., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=162, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 11, 7], llm_incoming=[37], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 162 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need to align our orders closely with anticipated demand, and the Wholesaler agreed on the importance of proactive monitoring of demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should continue to prioritize aligning our orders with actual demand to avoid potential stockouts and excess inventory. Itâ€™s crucial that we coordinate effectively to mitigate the bullwhip effect across our supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to manage my backlog and align with the expected demand while remaining cautious of fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for real-time updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders closely with anticipated demand, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent overstock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on our current inventory and projected demand to optimize our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover my backlog while monitoring future demand trends closely.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [41, 41, 37]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [140]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 41
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [55, 87, 63]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [79]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 100
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

--------------------- Round 6 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [41, 87, 85, 239]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated with orders of 11, 7, and 8. This suggests a potential trend toward lower demand than anticipated. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial, and I suggest we coordinate our order quantities to minimize excess stock across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our next orders. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 30 units this round to balance my inventory and expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: Monitor demand trends closely and adjust orders accordingly to avoid excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts to align our supply decisions, helping to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 195 units in inventory and no backlog, with an expected demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that recent demand has fluctuated with orders of 11, 7, and 8, suggesting a trend toward lower demand than anticipated. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should proceed cautiously with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 30 units to cover my current inventory and expected demand, while being mindful of potential stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: Align order quantities based on recent demand trends to prevent overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to better coordinate our orders and minimize excess stock across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 135 units in inventory and no backlog, with an expected demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that recent demand has fluctuated with orders of 11, 7, and 8, suggesting lower demand trends. Wholesaler echoed this sentiment and emphasized caution in our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to align with expected demand and maintain efficiency in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on cautious ordering based on recent demand trends to minimize excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 13 units in inventory, no backlog, and I expect a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said there is a trend toward lower demand with orders of 11, 7, and 8, and I also note that Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this caution.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 195 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Update Output: {}
    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 13 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [41, 37, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [133]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will order to cover expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 106 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [87, 63, 72]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [72]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 80
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [37, 63, 140, 159]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align orders with demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be more proactive in sharing our inventory levels and demand trends. Therefore, I will share that I have observed a recent demand increase with orders of 7, 8, and 13 units, leading to my anticipation of a demand of 30 units next round.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 30 units to align with expected demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that all agents share their inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce uncertainty.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 219 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand increase.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a recent demand increase with orders of 7, 8, and 13 units, leading to their anticipation of a demand of 30 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that the overall demand across our supply chain is rising, and we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and overstock situations. Therefore, I will continue to place my order for 30 units to align with this anticipated demand while managing my current inventory of 165 units.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order with the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce uncertainty across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 165 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to fulfill my order without immediate concerns.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer mentioned a recent demand increase with anticipated orders of 30 units next round, and Wholesaler agreed, indicating overall rising demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to prevent stockouts and manage our inventory levels effectively. Therefore, I will order 20 units to cover the expected demand while keeping some buffer in my inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order with expected demand while preventing overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance our order alignment and reduce uncertainties.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 90 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to demand shifts.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a recent demand increase with orders of 7, 8, and 13 units, leading to an anticipated demand of 30 units next round. The Wholesaler agreed with this assessment, indicating overall rising demand. The Distributor also echoed this sentiment, planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all anticipating a significant increase in demand. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain my inventory levels without overcommitting, while keeping an eye on the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Strategy Hint: I will balance my order to meet expected demand while minimizing the risk of overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce uncertainty across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 177 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to adjust to demand changes.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for coordinated orders due to rising demand, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment by planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the demand increase and need to align our orders to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units to meet the anticipated demand while ensuring I maintain my inventory buffer.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order with the expected demand while being mindful of my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a weekly update system for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which can help us align our orders more effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 219 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet the anticipated demand increase.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for coordinated orders to prevent stockouts and that they will place an order for 30 units. The Distributor also echoed this, planning to order 20 units to cover expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the rising demand across the supply chain. I also noted the Factory's response, indicating a similar understanding of the demand increase. Therefore, I will maintain my order for 30 units to align with our collective anticipation while managing my current inventory of 165 units effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order with expected demand while keeping track of inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement regular updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance our alignment and reduce uncertainties.
  Information Shared: I currently have 165 units in inventory and no backlog, positioning me well to meet the anticipated demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear Retailer mentioned an anticipated demand of 30 units next round, and Wholesaler confirmed the need for coordinated orders due to rising demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that our supply chain is responding to a significant demand increase that we all need to address collaboratively. Therefore, I will maintain my order for 20 units to cover expected demand while keeping a buffer in my inventory to manage fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order with expected demand while preventing overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a regular update system for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which can help us better align our orders and reduce uncertainties.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 90 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to demand shifts.

Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer mentioned placing an order for 30 units to meet anticipated demand, and the Wholesaler and Distributor are also aligning their orders due to rising demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need to manage our orders carefully to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain my inventory levels while anticipating the collective demand increase.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order with expected demand while minimizing the risk of overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which can help us align orders more effectively and reduce uncertainties.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 219, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 13, Profit: 65.00, Total Profit: -175.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=I have sufficient inventory to meet expected demand and prevent stockouts while keeping a buffer., risk_assessment=Possible fluctuations in demand could lead to excess inventory or backlog if not monitored., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=219, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[7, 8, 13], llm_incoming=[33], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 219 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 90 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [37, 38, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [88]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 177 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [63, 72, 63]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [63]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 80
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 247, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -249.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=With sufficient inventory, I will account for expected demand while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Inventory may become excessive if demand drops unexpectedly., expected_demand_next_round=10, llm_inventory=247, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8, 13, 10], llm_incoming=[40], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 247 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 153 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [38, 33, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [100]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 229 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [72, 63, 70]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [70]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that recent demand has shown variability, with orders at 13, 10, and 19 units, indicating potential for both excess inventory and backlog if not managed carefully. The Wholesaler echoed this by emphasizing the need to closely monitor inventory levels and adjust orders accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all have sufficient inventory at the moment, the variability in demand could create challenges if we don't coordinate our orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover the expected demand while maintaining a buffer against fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication cadence to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we can adjust our orders collectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that recent demand has shown variability, with orders at 13, 10, and 19 units, indicating potential for both excess inventory and backlog if not managed carefully. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about monitoring inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to remain vigilant about our inventory and ordering strategies to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain my inventory while aligning with the anticipated demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our coordination and planning efforts.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect. The Distributor and Factory echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the variability in demand and the impact it can have on our inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 30 units to align with my expected demand while keeping a close eye on inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our coordination and planning efforts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to 30 units to align with expected demand while monitoring inventory levels.

  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our coordination and optimize ordering strategies.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to 30 units to align with expected demand while monitoring inventory levels. The Wholesaler emphasized the need to prevent the bullwhip effect through careful inventory monitoring. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all acknowledge demand variability, we must coordinate our efforts to mitigate risks. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to cover the expected demand while ensuring I do not overstock, given my current inventory level of 172 units.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our collective response to demand fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to 30 units to align with expected demand while monitoring inventory levels. The Wholesaler and Distributor also recognized the importance of coordination to manage variability in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all understand the need to be vigilant about our inventory and ordering strategies to prevent excess stock and backlog. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain my inventory while aligning with anticipated fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory updates, enhancing our coordination and allowing us to respond effectively to demand changes.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 172 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [33, 40, 39]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [99]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that recent demand has shown variability, with orders at 13, 10, and 19 units, indicating potential for both excess inventory and backlog if not managed carefully. The Wholesaler echoed this by emphasizing the need to closely monitor inventory levels and adjust orders accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all have sufficient inventory at the moment, the variability in demand could create challenges if we don't coordinate our orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover the expected demand while maintaining a buffer against fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication cadence to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we can adjust our orders collectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that recent demand has shown variability, with orders at 13, 10, and 19 units, indicating potential for both excess inventory and backlog if not managed carefully. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about monitoring inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to remain vigilant about our inventory and ordering strategies to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain my inventory while aligning with the anticipated demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our coordination and planning efforts.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect. The Distributor and Factory echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the variability in demand and the impact it can have on our inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 30 units to align with my expected demand while keeping a close eye on inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our coordination and planning efforts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to 30 units to align with expected demand while monitoring inventory levels. The Distributor and Factory also emphasized the need for coordination to manage variability in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of closely monitoring our inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units, ensuring that I align with the expected demand while being prepared for fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our coordination and optimize ordering strategies.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to 30 units to align with expected demand while monitoring inventory levels. The Wholesaler emphasized the need to prevent the bullwhip effect through careful inventory monitoring. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all acknowledge demand variability, we must coordinate our efforts to mitigate risks. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to cover the expected demand while ensuring I do not overstock, given my current inventory level of 172 units.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our collective response to demand fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to 30 units to align with expected demand while monitoring inventory levels. The Wholesaler and Distributor also recognized the importance of coordination to manage variability in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all understand the need to be vigilant about our inventory and ordering strategies to prevent excess stock and backlog. Therefore, I will place a moderate order of 20 units to maintain my inventory while aligning with anticipated fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory updates, enhancing our coordination and allowing us to respond effectively to demand changes.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 233 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [63, 70, 69]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [69]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 70
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable initial inventory and no backlog, I can afford to place a moderate order to maintain inventory levels while anticipating future demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that recent demand has shown variability, with orders at 13, 10, and 19 units, indicating potential for both excess inventory and backlog if not managed carefully. The Wholesaler echoed this by emphasizing the need to closely monitor inventory levels and adjust orders accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all have sufficient inventory at the moment, the variability in demand could create challenges if we don't coordinate our orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover the expected demand while maintaining a buffer against fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication cadence to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we can adjust our orders collectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that recent demand has shown variability, with orders at 13, 10, and 19 units, indicating potential for both excess inventory and backlog if not managed carefully.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 19, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 206 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 39, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [96]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 277 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [70, 69, 66]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [66]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 70
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable initial inventory and no backlog, I can afford to place a moderate order to maintain inventory levels while anticipating future demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "Risk of over-ordering could lead to increased holding costs if demand decreases unexpectedly.",

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.
