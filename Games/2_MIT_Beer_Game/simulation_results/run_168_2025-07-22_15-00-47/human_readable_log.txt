--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $694.00, but I experienced a loss of $6.00 last round, which threatens my profitability. I have 92 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our orders, we can maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain steady inventory levels.
  Information Shared: I currently have 92 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful order planning.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $694.00, but I experienced a loss of $6.00 last round, which threatens my profitability. With 92 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet current demand, but we must plan our orders carefully to avoid fluctuations. Therefore, I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits. We need to be cautious of potential stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the market.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders to maintain steady inventory levels and minimize costs.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 92, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 8, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: 674.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=8, confidence=0.9, rationale=To meet the expected demand of 8 units while maintaining a buffer, I will order 8 units., risk_assessment=The main risk is over-ordering, which could increase holding costs. However, current demand suggests this order is necessary to avoid stockouts., expected_demand_next_round=8, llm_inventory=92, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8], llm_incoming=[8], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 92 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: -6.0
          - Current bank balance: $694.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [-6.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$694.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($694.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (92 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 92 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: -6.0
          - Current bank balance: $694.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [-6.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$694.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 92 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: -6.0
          - Current bank balance: $694.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [-6.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$694.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($694.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (92 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 92 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: -6.0
          - Current bank balance: $694.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [-6.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$694.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($694.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (92 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: -2.0
          - Current bank balance: $672.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: -2.0
          - Current bank balance: $672.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($672.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (84 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: -2.0
          - Current bank balance: $672.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($672.00) and how decisions affect it

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: -2.0
          - Current bank balance: $680.00

          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$694.00', '$680.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production closely with the expected demand to avoid excessive holding costs and ensure we can meet customer demand effectively. Therefore, I will schedule production to match the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 84 units and no backlog, as my recent profits have been negative. Let's work together to optimize our orders and maintain a stable supply chain flow to maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: 3.5
          - Current bank balance: $655.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$655.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: 3.5
          - Current bank balance: $635.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: 3.5
          - Current bank balance: $635.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 75 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: 7.5
          - Current bank balance: $675.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 7.5]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$694.00', '$680.00', '$675.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stockouts and ensuring customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any oversupply or stockouts in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 80 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the expected demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to monitor demand closely and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $648.00, and I am currently holding 80 units with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent oversupply or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to meet the expected demand while minimizing holding costs. Therefore, I will focus on maintaining my inventory at a healthy level while being cautious about over-ordering to avoid excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to adjust my order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to monitor our orders closely and adjust them based on the latest demand data to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $628.00, I have 80 units in inventory, and no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 80, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 623.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.7, rationale=To meet expected demand while avoiding stockouts, I will order slightly above the recent average demand., risk_assessment=There is a risk of over-ordering if demand decreases, leading to higher holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=10, llm_inventory=80, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8, 9, 11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=9
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: 15.0
          - Current bank balance: $648.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$655.50', '$648.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: 15.0
          - Current bank balance: $628.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($628.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (80 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: 15.0
          - Current bank balance: $628.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($628.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (80 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 64 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: 23.0
          - Current bank balance: $685.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 7.5, 23.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$694.00', '$680.00', '$675.50', '$685.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 78 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we coordinate our orders to align with the expected demand, ensuring that we all maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet customer needs without incurring excessive holding costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 16.0
          - Current bank balance: $639.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$655.50', '$648.00', '$639.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will propose that we all share our current inventory and backlog statuses to optimize our order quantities and ensure we meet demand without incurring unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: I suggest we align our orders based on the expected demand of 20 units for the next round to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all align our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, as I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits while avoiding the risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: I suggest we coordinate our orders to align with the expected demand of 20 units for the next round to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to align with expected demand and avoid excessive holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with the recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will adjust my production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 53 units and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to any changes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our production and orders to align with the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels without incurring excessive holding costs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 16.0
          - Current bank balance: $619.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by suggesting we align our orders based on recent demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels while avoiding excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our current inventory of 78 units and a backlog of 0 units, and I suggest we align our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units for the next round to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our current inventory and backlog statuses to optimize our order quantities and ensure we meet demand without incurring unnecessary costs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all align our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, as I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits while avoiding the risks of stockouts or oversupply.

- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to align with expected demand and avoid excessive holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with the recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will adjust my production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 53 units and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to any changes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our production and orders to align with the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels without incurring excessive holding costs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 16.0
          - Current bank balance: $619.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by suggesting we align our orders based on recent demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels while avoiding excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our current inventory of 78 units and a backlog of 0 units, and I suggest we align our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units for the next round to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our orders to align with the expected demand, ensuring a steady flow of products through the supply chain.

  Proposal: I suggest we align our orders based on the expected demand of 20 units for the next round to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to align with expected demand and avoid excessive holding costs.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to align with expected demand and avoid excessive holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all align our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, as I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits while avoiding the risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: I suggest we coordinate our orders to align with the expected demand of 20 units for the next round to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to align with expected demand and avoid excessive holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with the recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will adjust my production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 53 units and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to any changes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our production and orders to align with the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels without incurring excessive holding costs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 53 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 28.5
          - Current bank balance: $698.50
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 7.5, 23.0, 28.5]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$694.00', '$680.00', '$675.50', '$685.00', '$698.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by suggesting we align our orders based on recent demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels while avoiding excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our current inventory of 78 units and a backlog of 0 units, and I suggest we align our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units for the next round to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our orders to align with the expected demand, ensuring a steady flow of products through the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to align with the expected demand and avoid excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain a production level that meets the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 53 units and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to any changes in demand.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $621.50, and I have 75 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a stable supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.

I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $601.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning my orders with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to maximize our collective profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand but requires careful planning to avoid stockouts and holding costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 75 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 32.5
          - Current bank balance: $621.50
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$655.50', '$648.00', '$639.00', '$621.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 75 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 32.5
          - Current bank balance: $601.50
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to maintain a steady flow of supply while maximizing our profits. My current profit is $601.50, and I have 75 units in inventory with no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning to avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the anticipated demand to maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will produce a quantity that meets the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 39 units and zero backlog to avoid excessive holding costs.

- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities closely to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $621.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid excessive holding costs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($601.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (75 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 75 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 32.5
          - Current bank balance: $601.50
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to maintain a steady flow of supply while maximizing our profits. My current profit is $601.50, and I have 75 units in inventory with no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning to avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the anticipated demand to maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will produce a quantity that meets the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 39 units and zero backlog to avoid excessive holding costs.

- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities closely to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $621.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid excessive holding costs.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 39 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 50.5
          - Current bank balance: $734.00
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 7.5, 23.0, 28.5, 50.5]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$694.00', '$680.00', '$675.50', '$685.00', '$698.50', '$734.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to maintain a steady flow of supply while maximizing our profits. My current profit is $601.50, and I have 75 units in inventory with no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning to avoid excessive holding costs.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our ordering strategies and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to adjust my order quantity based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 14, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: -21.0
          - Current bank balance: $565.50
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0]

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 14, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: -21.0
          - Current bank balance: $545.50
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, especially since my last round profit was -21.0, which threatens my overall profit of $545.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our ordering strategies and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [11, 14, 4]
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: -21.0
          - Total profit so far: $545.50
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50']

        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($545.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (82 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 14, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: -21.0
          - Current bank balance: $545.50
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 14, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 2.5
          - Current bank balance: $718.50
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 7.5, 23.0, 28.5, 50.5, 2.5]

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, especially since my last round profit was -21.0, which threatens my overall profit of $545.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our ordering strategies and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply. It's crucial that we all understand our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my current backlog of 0 units. We must also consider the cost implications of holding versus backlog costs, as they directly affect our profit margins. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid any potential market collapse.

  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten my current profit of $718.50. My inventory is currently at 35 units with no backlog, and I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my current backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure we are all on the same page and can make informed decisions that benefit the entire supply chain. This will help us maintain a steady flow of products and avoid potential market collapse due to oscillations in supply and demand.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our production and maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production schedules closely to align with the recent demand trends. My current profit is $719.00, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned that if we do not manage our production and orders effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profitability. Therefore, I will maintain a cautious production level to meet expected demand while avoiding excess inventory, and I encourage everyone to share their demand forecasts to ensure we all stay profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to adjust my production to align with expected demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more openly to ensure we all meet customer demand without oversupplying, which can lead to increased holding costs for everyone.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $719.00, with an inventory of 29 units and no backlog, indicating a need for careful production planning to maintain profitability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 90 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: -15.0
          - Current bank balance: $515.50
          - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0]
          - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$655.50', '$648.00', '$639.00', '$621.50', '$565.50', '$515.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 90 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: -15.0
          - Current bank balance: $495.50
          - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0]
          - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and manage inventory effectively. I also note the Wholesaler's call for alignment in our ordering strategies to meet actual demand while minimizing holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs, which threaten my current profit of $495.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on recent demand trends and inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer demand without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and manage inventory effectively. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's calls for alignment in our ordering strategies to meet actual demand while minimizing holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our production schedules to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs, which threaten my current profit of $719.00. Therefore, I will maintain a production level that aligns with the recent demand trends while being cautious of overproduction, given my current inventory of 29 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more openly to ensure we all meet customer demand without oversupplying, which can lead to increased holding costs for everyone.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of synchronizing our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to meet actual demand while minimizing costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better match the recent demand trends and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production schedules closely to align with the recent demand trends. My current profit is $719.00, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned that if we do not manage our production and orders effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profitability. Therefore, I will maintain a cautious production level to meet expected demand while avoiding excess inventory, and I encourage everyone to share their demand forecasts to ensure we all stay profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more openly to ensure we all meet customer demand without oversupplying, which can lead to increased holding costs for everyone.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 90 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: -15.0
          - Current bank balance: $495.50
          - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0]
          - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and manage inventory effectively. I also note the Wholesaler's call for alignment in our ordering strategies to meet actual demand while minimizing holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs, which threaten my current profit of $495.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on recent demand trends and inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer demand without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and manage inventory effectively. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's calls for alignment in our ordering strategies to meet actual demand while minimizing holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our production schedules to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs, which threaten my current profit of $719.00. Therefore, I will maintain a production level that aligns with the recent demand trends while being cautious of overproduction, given my current inventory of 29 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more openly to ensure we all meet customer demand without oversupplying, which can lead to increased holding costs for everyone.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of synchronizing our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to meet actual demand while minimizing costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better match the recent demand trends and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production schedules closely to align with the recent demand trends. My current profit is $719.00, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned that if we do not manage our production and orders effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profitability. Therefore, I will maintain a cautious production level to meet expected demand while avoiding excess inventory, and I encourage everyone to share their demand forecasts to ensure we all stay profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more openly to ensure we all meet customer demand without oversupplying, which can lead to increased holding costs for everyone.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 15.5
          - Current bank balance: $719.00
          - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 7.5, 23.0, 28.5, 50.5, 2.5, 15.5]
          - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$694.00', '$680.00', '$675.50', '$685.00', '$698.50', '$734.00', '$718.50', '$719.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($719.00) and how decisions affect it

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 6, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 8.0
          - Current bank balance: $473.50
          - Profit history (last 9 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0]
          - Balance history (last 9 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$655.50', '$648.00', '$639.00', '$621.50', '$565.50', '$515.50', '$473.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($473.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (84 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 6, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: 8.0
          - Current bank balance: $468.50
          - Profit history (last 9 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0]
          - Balance history (last 9 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$468.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and excessive inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders based on recent demand trends to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our order quantities accordingly to ensure a steady flow of supply while minimizing holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's collaborate on our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable, especially considering my current profit of $453.50.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and excessive inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 19 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future production to avoid potential stock-outs. Therefore, I will schedule production to match the expected demand while keeping an eye on holding costs to ensure we all remain profitable.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($468.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (84 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 6, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 8.0
          - Current bank balance: $453.50
          - Profit history (last 9 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0]
          - Balance history (last 9 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$453.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($453.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (84 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 19 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 6, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 40.5
          - Current bank balance: $744.50
          - Profit history (last 9 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 7.5, 23.0, 28.5, 50.5, 2.5, 15.5, 40.5]
          - Balance history (last 9 rounds): ['$694.00', '$680.00', '$675.50', '$685.00', '$698.50', '$734.00', '$718.50', '$719.00', '$744.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($744.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (19 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit stands at $433.00, and I have 81 units in inventory with no backlog. To maximize our total supply chain profits, we must carefully plan our orders to avoid excessive holding costs while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to maintain stability and profitability across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to optimize our supply chain flow and maximize profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

          - Current bank balance: $448.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$468.50', '$448.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit stands at $433.00, and I have 81 units in inventory with no backlog. To maximize our total supply chain profits, we must carefully plan our orders to avoid excessive holding costs while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to maintain stability and profitability across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to optimize our supply chain flow and maximize profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 4.5
          - Current bank balance: $433.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$694.00', '$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$453.50', '$433.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit stands at $433.00, and I have 81 units in inventory with no backlog. To maximize our total supply chain profits, we must carefully plan our orders to avoid excessive holding costs while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to maintain stability and profitability across the chain.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 40.0
          - Current bank balance: $769.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-6.0, -2.0, 7.5, 23.0, 28.5, 50.5, 2.5, 15.5, 40.5, 40.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$694.00', '$680.00', '$675.50', '$685.00', '$698.50', '$734.00', '$718.50', '$719.00', '$744.50', '$769.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit stands at $433.00, and I have 81 units in inventory with no backlog. To maximize our total supply chain profits, we must carefully plan our orders to avoid excessive holding costs while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to maintain stability and profitability across the chain.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 31.5
          - Current bank balance: $459.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5]

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($459.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (77 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 31.5
          - Current bank balance: $454.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$468.50', '$448.00', '$454.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($454.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (77 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 31.5
          - Current bank balance: $439.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-2.0, 3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$672.00', '$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$453.50', '$433.00', '$439.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: 44.0
          - Current bank balance: $800.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-2.0, 7.5, 23.0, 28.5, 50.5, 2.5, 15.5, 40.5, 40.0, 44.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$680.00', '$675.50', '$685.00', '$698.50', '$734.00', '$718.50', '$719.00', '$744.50', '$769.50', '$800.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: 44.0
          - Total profit so far: $800.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-2.0, 7.5, 23.0, 28.5, 50.5, 2.5, 15.5, 40.5, 40.0, 44.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$680.00', '$675.50', '$685.00', '$698.50', '$734.00', '$718.50', '$719.00', '$744.50', '$769.50', '$800.00']

}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        
        Other agents in the supply chain: Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($800.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (4 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$655.50', '$648.00', '$639.00', '$621.50', '$565.50', '$515.50', '$473.50', '$453.00', '$459.50', '$425.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $405.50, and I have 78 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us, while being cautious of holding costs that could threaten our profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which puts pressure on my production and affects the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog and align with your recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us. I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but also poses a risk of stock-outs if we do not manage our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits. I also note the Distributor's call for coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure steady inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly. My current profit is $420.50, and I have 78 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but also poses a risk if we do not manage our orders effectively. Let's coordinate to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profitability while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 14, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: 1.0
          - Current bank balance: $420.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$468.50', '$448.00', '$454.50', '$420.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $405.50, and I have 78 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us, while being cautious of holding costs that could threaten our profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which puts pressure on my production and affects the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog and align with your recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us. I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but also poses a risk of stock-outs if we do not manage our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 14, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: 1.0
          - Current bank balance: $405.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [3.5, 15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$635.50', '$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$453.50', '$433.00', '$439.50', '$405.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $405.50, and I have 78 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us, while being cautious of holding costs that could threaten our profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which puts pressure on my production and affects the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog and align with your recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us. I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but also poses a risk of stock-outs if we do not manage our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits. I also note the Distributor's call for coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure steady inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly. My current profit is $420.50, and I have 78 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but also poses a risk if we do not manage our orders effectively. Let's coordinate to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profitability while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units puts pressure on my production and affects the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and align with your recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us. It's crucial that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we remain profitable together.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 14, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: -18.0
          - Current bank balance: $761.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [7.5, 23.0, 28.5, 50.5, 2.5, 15.5, 40.5, 40.0, 44.0, -18.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$675.50', '$685.00', '$698.50', '$734.00', '$718.50', '$719.00', '$744.50', '$769.50', '$800.00', '$761.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 14.5
          - Current bank balance: $415.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$648.00', '$639.00', '$621.50', '$565.50', '$515.50', '$473.50', '$453.00', '$459.50', '$425.50', '$415.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($415.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (81 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 14.5
          - Current bank balance: $410.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$468.50', '$448.00', '$454.50', '$420.50', '$410.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to optimize our inventory and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we can meet customer needs without excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to optimize our inventory and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 19 units while being mindful of the recent demand trends to prevent excessive holding costs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($410.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (81 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 16.5
          - Current bank balance: $397.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [15.0, 16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 16.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$628.00', '$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$453.50', '$433.00', '$439.50', '$405.50', '$397.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to optimize our inventory and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we can meet customer needs without excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to optimize our inventory and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 19 units while being mindful of the recent demand trends to prevent excessive holding costs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($397.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (77 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 19 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 22
          - Last round profit: -8.5
          - Current bank balance: $719.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [23.0, 28.5, 50.5, 2.5, 15.5, 40.5, 40.0, 44.0, -18.0, -8.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$685.00', '$698.50', '$734.00', '$718.50', '$719.00', '$744.50', '$769.50', '$800.00', '$761.00', '$719.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (19 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($719.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (19 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 76 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand without oversupplying.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $392.00, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if we do not align our orders. I can only ship based on the orders I receive plus my backlog, which is currently zero.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to maintain steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively to meet actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction while also being mindful of holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, as my current profit of $392.00 is at risk if we do not align our strategies. I currently have 76 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid future stock-outs. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to keep our profits stable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs and ensuring I can fulfill downstream orders.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $407.00, and I have 76 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned that if we do not align our strategies, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could negatively impact all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 76 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 27.0
          - Current bank balance: $392.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$639.00', '$621.50', '$565.50', '$515.50', '$473.50', '$453.00', '$459.50', '$425.50', '$415.00', '$392.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, focusing on maintaining steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders effectively to meet actual demand without oversupplying, as my current profit of $400.00 is at risk due to potential holding costs from excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship based on the orders I receive plus my backlog, which is currently zero.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules effectively to meet actual demand without oversupplying, as my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders. Therefore, I will produce a quantity that addresses my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.

- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to maintain steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively to meet actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction while also being mindful of holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, as my current profit of $392.00 is at risk if we do not align our strategies. I currently have 76 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid future stock-outs. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to keep our profits stable.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $407.00, and I have 76 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned that if we do not align our strategies, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could negatively impact all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit of $400.00 is at risk due to potential holding costs from excess inventory, as I have 64 units in stock and no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and prevent oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 76 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 27.0
          - Current bank balance: $407.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [16.0, 32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0]

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, focusing on maintaining steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders effectively to meet actual demand without oversupplying, as my current profit of $400.00 is at risk due to potential holding costs from excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship based on the orders I receive plus my backlog, which is currently zero.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules effectively to meet actual demand without oversupplying, as my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders. Therefore, I will produce a quantity that addresses my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our production schedules and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to maintain steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively to meet actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction while also being mindful of holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, as my current profit of $392.00 is at risk if we do not align our strategies. I currently have 76 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid future stock-outs. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to keep our profits stable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $407.00, and I have 76 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned that if we do not align our strategies, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could negatively impact all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit of $400.00 is at risk due to potential holding costs from excess inventory, as I have 64 units in stock and no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and prevent oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders, which could negatively impact my profit of $704.50. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover my backlog while aligning with the recent demand trends to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our production schedules and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$619.00', '$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$453.50', '$433.00', '$439.50', '$405.50', '$397.00', '$400.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, focusing on maintaining steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders effectively to meet actual demand without oversupplying, as my current profit of $400.00 is at risk due to potential holding costs from excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship based on the orders I receive plus my backlog, which is currently zero.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules effectively to meet actual demand without oversupplying, as my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders. Therefore, I will produce a quantity that addresses my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our production schedules and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to maintain steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively to meet actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction while also being mindful of holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, as my current profit of $392.00 is at risk if we do not align our strategies. I currently have 76 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid future stock-outs. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to keep our profits stable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $407.00, and I have 76 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned that if we do not align our strategies, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could negatively impact all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit of $400.00 is at risk due to potential holding costs from excess inventory, as I have 64 units in stock and no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and prevent oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders, which could negatively impact my profit of $704.50. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover my backlog while aligning with the recent demand trends to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our production schedules and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 30.0
          - Current bank balance: $704.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [28.5, 50.5, 2.5, 15.5, 40.5, 40.0, 44.0, -18.0, -8.5, 30.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$698.50', '$734.00', '$718.50', '$719.00', '$744.50', '$769.50', '$800.00', '$761.00', '$719.50', '$704.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, focusing on maintaining steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders effectively to meet actual demand without oversupplying, as my current profit of $400.00 is at risk due to potential holding costs from excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship based on the orders I receive plus my backlog, which is currently zero.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules effectively to meet actual demand without oversupplying, as my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders. Therefore, I will produce a quantity that addresses my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our production schedules and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to maintain steady inventory levels while being cautious of over-ordering, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively to meet actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction while also being mindful of holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, as my current profit of $392.00 is at risk if we do not align our strategies. I currently have 76 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid future stock-outs. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to keep our profits stable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $407.00, and I have 76 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned that if we do not align our strategies, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could negatively impact all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit of $400.00 is at risk due to potential holding costs from excess inventory, as I have 64 units in stock and no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and prevent oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable while being mindful of holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders, which could negatively impact my profit of $704.50. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover my backlog while aligning with the recent demand trends to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our production schedules and maintain a steady flow of products, preventing the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $376.00, and I have 77 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't coordinate our orders, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect. This way, we can keep our profits stable and ensure a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 77 units and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to prevent any disruptions.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning my orders with the Retailer's demand while managing my inventory levels to minimize holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet immediate demand but requires us to plan our orders carefully to avoid any potential market instability.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 58 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to prevent any disruptions. My current profit is $393.50, and I am concerned about the potential risks of stockouts or excessive holding costs if we do not align our orders. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we do not align our efforts. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to avoid excess stock and holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on balancing production with current backlog and demand to optimize profits.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we meet demand without causing stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $736.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 11 units, which highlights the need for careful planning to maintain supply chain stability.

I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about the potential risks of stock-outs if we do not plan our orders carefully. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. This collaboration is crucial to maintaining steady profits and preventing market instability, which could hurt all of us. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to be mindful of our shipment constraints. My current profit is $376.00, and I want to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning my orders with the expected demand while managing my inventory levels to minimize holding costs.

    LLM Output: order_quantity=12, confidence=0.7, rationale=To cover expected demand and maintain a buffer, I will order 12 units., risk_assessment=Risk of stock-outs if demand exceeds expectations; need to balance inventory levels., expected_demand_next_round=12, llm_inventory=77, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 13, 10], llm_incoming=[10], llm_last_order=11
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 11.5
          - Current bank balance: $376.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$621.50', '$565.50', '$515.50', '$473.50', '$453.00', '$459.50', '$425.50', '$415.00', '$392.00', '$376.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 11.5
          - Current bank balance: $388.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$468.50', '$448.00', '$454.50', '$420.50', '$410.00', '$407.00', '$388.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 58 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to prevent any disruptions. My current profit is $393.50, and I am concerned about the potential risks of stockouts or excessive holding costs if we do not align our orders. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we do not align our efforts. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to avoid excess stock and holding costs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($388.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (77 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 58 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 21.0
          - Current bank balance: $393.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [32.5, -21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 16.5, 33.0, 21.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$601.50', '$545.50', '$495.50', '$453.50', '$433.00', '$439.50', '$405.50', '$397.00', '$400.00', '$393.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 58 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to prevent any disruptions. My current profit is $393.50, and I am concerned about the potential risks of stockouts or excessive holding costs if we do not align our orders. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we do not align our efforts. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to avoid excess stock and holding costs.

- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about the potential risks of stock-outs if we do not plan our orders carefully. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. This collaboration is crucial to maintaining steady profits and preventing market instability, which could hurt all of us. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to be mindful of our shipment constraints. My current profit is $376.00, and I want to ensure we all remain profitable.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 31
          - Last round profit: 78.5
          - Current bank balance: $736.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [50.5, 2.5, 15.5, 40.5, 40.0, 44.0, -18.0, -8.5, 30.0, 78.5]

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 58 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to prevent any disruptions. My current profit is $393.50, and I am concerned about the potential risks of stockouts or excessive holding costs if we do not align our orders. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we do not align our efforts. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to avoid excess stock and holding costs.

  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to stabilize the supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the current backlog and demand to avoid excessive holding costs and ensure we meet market needs. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog of 11 units while considering the recent demand trends to optimize our profits and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we meet demand without causing stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 79 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $361.50. I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs. If we all coordinate our orders based on true demand, we can prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Let's work together to keep our inventory aligned with market demand to maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize excess inventory or stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and proposed sharing demand forecasts. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production closely with actual demand to maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 12 units this round to address my current backlog of 2 units and the recent demand trend while keeping in mind the need to avoid excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on recent demand trends while addressing my backlog to maintain profitability.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the recent demand trends to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid excessive holding costs or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which requires immediate attention to prevent stock-outs. My total profit so far is $797.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain stability in our supply chain. I also note that the Factory is producing based on recent demand trends while addressing their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are on the same page and can optimize our inventory levels. My current profit is $361.50, and I have 79 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maximize our collective profits.

Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and excessive holding costs. I also note the Distributor's call for alignment with actual demand to maintain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure our orders reflect true demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 79 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. My current profit stands at $374.00, and I am concerned about potential risks of stock-outs or oversupply if we do not coordinate effectively.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect true demand to avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $389.00, and I have 59 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to prevent potential stock-outs or oversupply. Let's coordinate our orders effectively to maintain a steady flow and avoid any market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping my inventory levels in check to avoid high holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders based on the recent demand trends and share our forecasts to ensure we are all on the same page and can avoid excessive holding costs or stock-outs.

Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and excessive holding costs. I also note the Retailer's call for alignment with actual demand to maintain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our production aligns with the recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will produce 12 units this round to address my current backlog of 2 units and the recent demand trend while keeping in mind the need to avoid excess inventory.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 15.5
          - Current bank balance: $361.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5, 15.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$565.50', '$515.50', '$473.50', '$453.00', '$459.50', '$425.50', '$415.00', '$392.00', '$376.00', '$361.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 15.5
          - Current bank balance: $374.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5, 15.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$545.50', '$495.50', '$468.50', '$448.00', '$454.50', '$420.50', '$410.00', '$407.00', '$388.50', '$374.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and proposed sharing demand forecasts. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely with actual demand to maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can avoid excessive holding costs or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand trends and share our forecasts to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and proposed sharing demand forecasts. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production closely with actual demand to maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 12 units this round to address my current backlog of 2 units and the recent demand trend while keeping in mind the need to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the recent demand trends to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid excessive holding costs or stock-outs.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain stability in our supply chain. I also note that the Factory is producing based on recent demand trends while addressing their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are on the same page and can optimize our inventory levels. My current profit is $361.50, and I have 79 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand trends and share our forecasts to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and excessive holding costs. I also note the Distributor's call for alignment with actual demand to maintain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure our orders reflect true demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 79 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. My current profit stands at $374.00, and I am concerned about potential risks of stock-outs or oversupply if we do not coordinate effectively. Let's align our orders based on recent demand trends to maximize our collective profits and maintain a stable supply chain.

Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $389.00, and I have 59 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to prevent potential stock-outs or oversupply. Let's coordinate our orders effectively to maintain a steady flow and avoid any market instability.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 59 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 25.5
          - Current bank balance: $389.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-21.0, -15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 16.5, 33.0, 21.0, 25.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$545.50', '$495.50', '$453.50', '$433.00', '$439.50', '$405.50', '$397.00', '$400.00', '$393.50', '$389.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and proposed sharing demand forecasts. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely with actual demand to maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can avoid excessive holding costs or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand trends and share our forecasts to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and proposed sharing demand forecasts. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production closely with actual demand to maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 12 units this round to address my current backlog of 2 units and the recent demand trend while keeping in mind the need to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the recent demand trends to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid excessive holding costs or stock-outs.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain stability in our supply chain. I also note that the Factory is producing based on recent demand trends while addressing their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are on the same page and can optimize our inventory levels. My current profit is $361.50, and I have 79 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand trends and share our forecasts to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and excessive holding costs. I also note the Distributor's call for alignment with actual demand to maintain stability.

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 24
          - Last round profit: 97.0
          - Current bank balance: $797.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [2.5, 15.5, 40.5, 40.0, 44.0, -18.0, -8.5, 30.0, 78.5, 97.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$718.50', '$719.00', '$744.50', '$769.50', '$800.00', '$761.00', '$719.50', '$704.50', '$736.50', '$797.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($797.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (2 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $350.00, and I have 78 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't coordinate our orders, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all meet customer needs without excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 16.0
          - Current bank balance: $350.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5, 15.5, 16.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$515.50', '$473.50', '$453.00', '$459.50', '$425.50', '$415.00', '$392.00', '$376.00', '$361.50', '$350.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount of downstream orders plus my backlog. This will help us all avoid excessive holding costs and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 11]

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities around the recent demand of 10-11 units to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our strategies. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand of 10-11 units while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount of downstream orders plus my backlog. This will help us all avoid excessive holding costs and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities closely to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider ordering around the recent demand of 10-11 units to ensure we do not face stock-outs or excessive holding costs, which could threaten our profits. My current profit is $350.00, and I want to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding any risks of market instability.

My current profit is $362.50, and I want to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding any risks of market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities closely to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 67 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $383.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider ordering around the recent demand of 10-11 units to ensure we do not face stock-outs or excessive holding costs, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production closely with the recent demand of 10-11 units to ensure a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount of downstream orders plus my backlog. This will help us all avoid excessive holding costs and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 67 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 21.5
          - Current bank balance: $383.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-15.0, 8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 16.5, 33.0, 21.0, 25.5, 21.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$495.50', '$453.50', '$433.00', '$439.50', '$405.50', '$397.00', '$400.00', '$393.50', '$389.00', '$383.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities around the recent demand of 10-11 units to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our strategies. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand of 10-11 units while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount of downstream orders plus my backlog. This will help us all avoid excessive holding costs and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products.

- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities closely to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider ordering around the recent demand of 10-11 units to ensure we do not face stock-outs or excessive holding costs, which could threaten our profits. My current profit is $350.00, and I want to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding any risks of market instability.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Current bank balance: $830.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [15.5, 40.5, 40.0, 44.0, -18.0, -8.5, 30.0, 78.5, 97.0, 52.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$719.00', '$744.50', '$769.50', '$800.00', '$761.00', '$719.50', '$704.50', '$736.50', '$797.50', '$830.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities around the recent demand of 10-11 units to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10-11 units to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our strategies. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand of 10-11 units while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount of downstream orders plus my backlog. This will help us all avoid excessive holding costs and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products.

- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities closely to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider ordering around the recent demand of 10-11 units to ensure we do not face stock-outs or excessive holding costs, which could threaten our profits. My current profit is $350.00, and I want to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding any risks of market instability.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 21.5
          - Current bank balance: $344.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5, 15.5, 16.0, 21.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$473.50', '$453.00', '$459.50', '$425.50', '$415.00', '$392.00', '$376.00', '$361.50', '$350.00', '$344.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 21.5
          - Current bank balance: $356.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5, 15.5, 16.0, 21.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$468.50', '$448.00', '$454.50', '$420.50', '$410.00', '$407.00', '$388.50', '$374.00', '$362.50', '$356.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to maintain a balanced flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and avoid excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and current inventory statuses to ensure we are all aligned in our ordering strategies and to prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our inventory statuses to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to avoid excessive backlog and holding costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which is impacting my profit of $805.50.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 75 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 22.5
          - Current bank balance: $378.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [8.0, 4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 16.5, 33.0, 21.0, 25.5, 21.5, 22.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$453.50', '$433.00', '$439.50', '$405.50', '$397.00', '$400.00', '$393.50', '$389.00', '$383.00', '$378.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to maintain a balanced flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and avoid excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and current inventory statuses to ensure we are all aligned in our ordering strategies and to prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our inventory statuses to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to avoid excessive backlog and holding costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which is impacting my profit of $805.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced flow of products and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($378.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (75 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: -8.0
          - Current bank balance: $805.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [40.5, 40.0, 44.0, -18.0, -8.5, 30.0, 78.5, 97.0, 52.0, -8.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$744.50', '$769.50', '$800.00', '$761.00', '$719.50', '$704.50', '$736.50', '$797.50', '$830.00', '$805.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $308.50, but I experienced a loss of $5.5 last round, which threatens my profitability. With 81 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet current demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -5.5
          - Current bank balance: $308.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5, 15.5, 16.0, 21.5, -5.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$453.00', '$459.50', '$425.50', '$415.00', '$392.00', '$376.00', '$361.50', '$350.00', '$344.00', '$308.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively impact everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17 units puts me at risk of not meeting demand, which threatens my profit of $754.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while being mindful of the overall demand trends shared by all of you. I propose that we align our production and order strategies to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively impact everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts, ensuring we all maintain profitability.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

I currently have 81 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit of $321.00 is threatened by the recent loss of $5.5. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively impact everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our supply chain. My current profit of $343.50 is threatened by my last round loss of -4.5, and I have 79 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively impact everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17 units puts me at risk of not meeting demand, which threatens my profit of $754.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while being mindful of the overall demand trends shared by all of you. I propose that we align our production and order strategies to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively impact everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts, ensuring we all maintain profitability.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -4.5
          - Current bank balance: $343.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [4.5, 31.5, 1.0, 16.5, 33.0, 21.0, 25.5, 21.5, 22.5, -4.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$433.00', '$439.50', '$405.50', '$397.00', '$400.00', '$393.50', '$389.00', '$383.00', '$378.00', '$343.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all remain profitable. I currently have 79 units in inventory and no backlog, but my last round profit was -4.5, which threatens my overall profit of $343.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to ensure we all remain profitable. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand and incurring backlog costs. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while being mindful of the overall demand trends shared by all of you.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (17 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all remain profitable. I currently have 79 units in inventory and no backlog, but my last round profit was -4.5, which threatens my overall profit of $343.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

--------------------- Round 20 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Orders received per agent: [8, 8, 8, 8]
Shipments received per agent: [12, 12, 2, 12]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 85 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit is $276.00, but I experienced a loss of $2.5 last round. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I have 85 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $276.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our demand forecasts and order quantities to maintain a balanced flow of products throughout the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our upcoming demand estimates and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a steady inventory while fulfilling orders to avoid excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our shared demand forecasts to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 85 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $293.50. My recent profit trajectory has been affected by losses, and I want to ensure we avoid any further instability in the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 85 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -2.5
          - Current bank balance: $276.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5, 15.5, 16.0, 21.5, -5.5, -2.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$459.50', '$425.50', '$415.00', '$392.00', '$376.00', '$361.50', '$350.00', '$344.00', '$308.50', '$276.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 85 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -2.5
          - Current bank balance: $293.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [31.5, 1.0, 14.5, 27.0, 11.5, 15.5, 16.0, 21.5, -5.5, -2.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$454.50', '$420.50', '$410.00', '$407.00', '$388.50', '$374.00', '$362.50', '$356.50', '$321.00', '$293.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our demand forecasts to maintain a balanced flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our order quantities and avoid excessive inventory that could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our shared demand forecasts to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our demand forecasts to maintain a balanced flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our order quantities and avoid excessive inventory that could hurt our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 13 units, which puts pressure on my production and affects the entire supply chain. If we do not align our production and order strategies, we risk stockouts and instability in the market. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand while minimizing holding costs and maximizing our total profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 73 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 3.5
          - Current bank balance: $322.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [31.5, 1.0, 16.5, 33.0, 21.0, 25.5, 21.5, 22.5, -4.5, 3.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$439.50', '$405.50', '$397.00', '$400.00', '$393.50', '$389.00', '$383.00', '$378.00', '$343.50', '$322.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($322.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (73 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 13 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 27
          - Last round profit: 40.5
          - Current bank balance: $754.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [44.0, -18.0, -8.5, 30.0, 78.5, 97.0, 52.0, -8.0, -15.5, 40.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$800.00', '$761.00', '$719.50', '$704.50', '$736.50', '$797.50', '$830.00', '$805.50', '$754.00', '$754.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (13 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($754.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (13 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5.0

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5.0 profit for each unit sold
          • 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: If your bank-account balance ever reaches $0 or below, you are bankrupt and the simulation ends. Plan orders so your balance always stays positive.
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
          • **If your profits are negative or consistently low, consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
