--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 1, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 15, Total Cost: 0.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=15, confidence=0.9, rationale=To cover expected demand and potential fluctuations, ordering slightly above the expected demand ensures inventory levels are sufficient to meet demand without backlog., risk_assessment=The risk of overordering is present, but maintaining a balance between holding costs and backlog is crucial. This order aims to stabilize inventory levels., expected_demand_next_round=12
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:

          - Backlog: 0
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "rationale": "To balance the lead time and expected demand, ordering slightly above anticipated demand compensates for potential variability and avoids backlog.",
  "risk_assessment": "The primary risk is overestimating demand, leading to higher holding costs, but this strategy mitigates backlog costs and reduces bullwhip effect.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12
}

        Given this state, how many units do you order from your upstream supplier 
        **this round**? Return valid JSON with:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
