--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining consistent inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stockouts and overstock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should better coordinate our orders to match demand more closely. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round, anticipating increased demand.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning our orders with observed demand trends to minimize fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our anticipated demand for the next few rounds so we can synchronize orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 100 units in inventory and expect demand to rise to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining consistent inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stockouts and overstock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better coordinate our orders to match the anticipated demand. I also observe that the Retailer expects demand to rise to 20 units next round, which is significantly lower than my expected demand of 80 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 80 units to maintain my buffer above the expected demand while being mindful of the Retailer's order.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our anticipated demand for the next few rounds to synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 100 units in inventory and expect demand to rise to 80 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should better coordinate our orders to match demand more closely and expects demand to rise to 20 units next round. I also hear the Wholesaler expects demand to rise to 80 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a significant discrepancy in our demand expectations that could lead to inefficiencies. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to balance my inventory while being prepared for higher demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning our orders with observed demand trends and maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share anticipated demand for the upcoming rounds to help synchronize our orders.
  Information Shared: I currently have 100 units in inventory and anticipate a demand of 40 units next round based on the trends observed.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should better coordinate our orders to match demand more closely and anticipates a rise to 20 units next round. I also hear the Wholesaler expects demand to rise to 80 units, which is significantly higher than the Retailer's expectation. Additionally, the Distributor plans to order 40 units based on observed trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a substantial discrepancy in our demand forecasts that could lead to inefficiencies in our supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain sufficient inventory while preparing for the potential demand fluctuations and aligning with the Distributor's order.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on balancing inventory levels while considering the varying demand forecasts from all agents.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we maintain regular communication to align our forecasts and orders more closely, reducing the risk of stockouts and overstock.
  Information Shared: I currently have 100 units in inventory and expect demand to rise to 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler said that they expect demand to rise to 80 units next round, which is significantly higher than my anticipated demand of 20 units. I also hear the Distributor plans to order 40 units, indicating a more moderate expectation. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a substantial discrepancy in our demand forecasts that could lead to inefficiencies across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units as originally planned to align with my expected demand while being mindful of the potential need for adjustments in future rounds.
  Strategy Hint: Align our orders with realistic demand forecasts to minimize excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our demand forecasts to better synchronize our orders and reduce inefficiencies.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 100 units in inventory and expect demand to rise to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining consistent inventory levels is crucial and they expect demand to rise to 20 units next round, which is significantly lower than my expected demand of 80 units. I also hear the Distributor plans to order 40 units, which indicates a more moderate expectation. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a significant discrepancy in our demand forecasts that could lead to inefficiencies. Therefore, I will place an order of 80 units to maintain my buffer while being mindful of the overall forecasted demand.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a system to share our anticipated demand more regularly to better synchronize our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 100 units in inventory and expect demand to rise to 80 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they expect demand to rise to 20 units next round, while the Wholesaler anticipates a much higher demand of 80 units. This discrepancy highlights the need for better coordination among us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our expectations more closely to avoid stockouts or overstock. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to maintain a balance while preparing for potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with observed demand trends while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our anticipated demand for the next few rounds regularly to synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 100 units in inventory and anticipate a demand of 40 units next round based on observed trends.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they expect demand to rise to 20 units next round, while the Wholesaler anticipates a much higher demand of 80 units. Additionally, the Distributor mentioned placing an order of 40 units, indicating a more moderate expectation. Based on this, my conclusion is that there remains a significant discrepancy in our demand forecasts, which could lead to inefficiencies. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 50 units to maintain a buffer while being prepared for potential fluctuations in demand and align more closely with the Distributor's order.
  Strategy Hint: Aim for a balanced inventory strategy while considering varying demand expectations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular communication to share our anticipated demand for the next rounds, helping us synchronize orders and reduce inefficiencies.
  Information Shared: I currently have 100 units in inventory and expect demand to rise to 50 units next round.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 110, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -5.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=I have enough inventory to meet expected demand while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Potential for demand fluctuations may lead to overstock or stockouts., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=100, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10], llm_incoming=[10], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

  "risk_assessment": "Demand fluctuations could lead to overstock or shortage if miscalculated.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively low, with only 10 units ordered. This indicates a potential for increased demand in the next rounds. I recommend that we all communicate our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Collaboration will help us balance inventory and fulfill demand effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear that some of you might be experiencing fluctuations in demand. To mitigate the bullwhip effect, I recommend we share our demand forecasts regularly. Based on this, my conclusion is that increased communication will help us align orders more accurately. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory and place an order of 50 units to better prepare for the expected demand next round.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to coordinate our orders effectively.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been lower than expected, with only 10 units ordered. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider adjusting our order quantities to align with the anticipated demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to ensure I can meet possible increases in demand while minimizing excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our forecasts for the next round to align our orders and reduce the risk of overstock and stockouts across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have not received any communication from the other agents yet, but I want to share my current inventory status and expected demand. It's crucial for us to coordinate effectively to minimize fluctuations. I suggest that we all provide our current inventory levels and any demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update schedule for our inventory and demand forecasts to enhance our supply chain visibility.
- Distributor: I hear that coordination among us is crucial to minimize fluctuations in inventory levels. Maintaining clear communication can help us avoid stockouts and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider sharing our expected demands more frequently. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on any updates from each of you.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and inventory levels better.
- Factory: I notice that our recent orders indicate a demand of 10 units. It’s important for us all to maintain visibility on demand to optimize our inventory levels. I hear that managing excess inventory is a concern across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate on demand forecasts to stabilize our orders. Therefore, I will maintain an inventory of 100 units and prepare to order 50 units to meet the expected demand in the next round.
  Proposal: Let's share our projected demands and any inventory constraints to minimize the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively low, with only 10 units ordered. This indicates a potential for increased demand in the next rounds. I recommend that we all communicate our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Collaboration will help us balance inventory and fulfill demand effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear that some of you might be experiencing fluctuations in demand. To mitigate the bullwhip effect, I recommend we share our demand forecasts regularly. Based on this, my conclusion is that increased communication will help us align orders more accurately. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory and place an order of 50 units to better prepare for the expected demand next round.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to coordinate our orders effectively.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been lower than expected, with only 10 units ordered. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider adjusting our order quantities to align with the anticipated demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to ensure I can meet possible increases in demand while minimizing excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our forecasts for the next round to align our orders and reduce the risk of overstock and stockouts across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have not received any communication from the other agents yet, but I want to share my current inventory status and expected demand. It's crucial for us to coordinate effectively to minimize fluctuations. I suggest that we all provide our current inventory levels and any demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update schedule for our inventory and demand forecasts to enhance our supply chain visibility.
- Distributor: I hear that coordination among us is crucial to minimize fluctuations in inventory levels. Maintaining clear communication can help us avoid stockouts and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider sharing our expected demands more frequently. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on any updates from each of you.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and inventory levels better.
- Factory: I notice that our recent orders indicate a demand of 10 units. It’s important for us all to maintain visibility on demand to optimize our inventory levels. I hear that managing excess inventory is a concern across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate on demand forecasts to stabilize our orders. Therefore, I will maintain an inventory of 100 units and prepare to order 50 units to meet the expected demand in the next round.
  Proposal: Let's share our projected demands and any inventory constraints to minimize the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 107 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -5.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer is experiencing fluctuating demand patterns. This is significant as it may lead to stockouts or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our order quantities to align with real-time demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 40 units to mitigate potential stockouts while keeping a buffer stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that there has been a significant increase in recent demand, particularly with the last order noted at 53 units. This indicates a potential shift in consumer preferences. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our order quantities to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to align with the expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to synchronize our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Retailer: I hear that other agents have been experiencing fluctuating demand patterns, which could lead to challenges in inventory management. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to stabilize supply and demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to align with anticipated demand while avoiding backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more regularly to better align our supply chain decisions.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent orders have been fluctuating with a demand of 10 and 13 units. I hear that managing inventory is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our orders to align better with demand. Therefore, I will maintain an inventory level that provides a buffer while placing an order of 80 units to meet expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear there might be fluctuations in demand, and I've noted recent orders of 10 and 33 units. This suggests potential variability that we all need to account for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should remain cautious about ordering too much at once to avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units to balance the current inventory and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our anticipated demand for the next round to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, with the last two orders being 10 and 53 units respectively. This variability suggests that we should be cautious about overcommitting resources. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to better match anticipated demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to strike a balance between meeting potential demand spikes and avoiding excessive inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more regularly to better align our supply chain decisions.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent orders have been fluctuating with a demand of 10 and 13 units. I hear that managing inventory is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our orders to align better with demand. Therefore, I will maintain an inventory level that provides a buffer while placing an order of 80 units to meet expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear there might be fluctuations in demand, and I've noted recent orders of 10 and 33 units. This suggests potential variability that we all need to account for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should remain cautious about ordering too much at once to avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units to balance the current inventory and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our anticipated demand for the next round to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, with the last two orders being 10 and 53 units respectively. This variability suggests that we should be cautious about overcommitting resources. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to better match anticipated demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to strike a balance between meeting potential demand spikes and avoiding excessive inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: 40.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer is experiencing fluctuating demand patterns. This is significant as it may lead to stockouts or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our order quantities to align with real-time demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 40 units to mitigate potential stockouts while keeping a buffer stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.

- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent orders have been fluctuating with a demand of 10 and 13 units. I hear that managing inventory is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our orders to align better with demand. Therefore, I will maintain an inventory level that provides a buffer while placing an order of 80 units to meet expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear there might be fluctuations in demand, and I've noted recent orders of 10 and 33 units. This suggests potential variability that we all need to account for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should remain cautious about ordering too much at once to avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units to balance the current inventory and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our anticipated demand for the next round to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, with the last two orders being 10 and 53 units respectively. This variability suggests that we should be cautious about overcommitting resources. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to better match anticipated demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to strike a balance between meeting potential demand spikes and avoiding excessive inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 113 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 8.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I am currently observing a significant increase in demand with recent orders of 10, 33, and 31 units. This trend suggests potential volatility in our supply chain. I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of clear communication around demand signals. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should remain vigilant about our inventory levels and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units to buffer against potential future demand surges.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in demand, with recent orders spiking to 61 units. This indicates potential volatility in our supply chain. I propose we share our projected demand more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that improved communication will help us all manage our inventories more effectively. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity while monitoring market trends closely.
  Proposal: Let's establish regular updates on demand forecasts to synchronize our orders and minimize excess backlog.
- Retailer: I currently have an inventory of 113 units and a recent demand pattern showing orders of 10, 13, and 11. I hear that maintaining an optimal inventory level is crucial, as it can help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to match anticipated demand more closely. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round, ensuring I have enough stock to meet expected demand while remaining cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our forecasted demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. This is crucial as my recent orders indicate a consistent increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for a potential spike in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a higher order quantity to ensure we avoid backlogs while also considering my current inventory levels.
  Proposal: I suggest we synchronize our order quantities to avoid excess inventory and potential stockouts, especially if demand continues to rise.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders significantly varying between 10 and 33 units. This indicates a potential volatility in demand that we all need to monitor closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 40 units this round to maintain my buffer and meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts with each other to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that there has been significant demand variability recently. The last orders from the Retailer indicated a spike in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our inventory levels more closely to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to cover the expected demand while minimizing backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to help synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 66 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 13, 11]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 56.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I am currently observing a significant increase in demand with recent orders of 10, 33, and 31 units. This trend suggests potential volatility in our supply chain. I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of clear communication around demand signals. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should remain vigilant about our inventory levels and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units to buffer against potential future demand surges.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in demand, with recent orders spiking to 61 units. This indicates potential volatility in our supply chain. I propose we share our projected demand more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that improved communication will help us all manage our inventories more effectively. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity while monitoring market trends closely.
  Proposal: Let's establish regular updates on demand forecasts to synchronize our orders and minimize excess backlog.
- Retailer: I currently have an inventory of 113 units and a recent demand pattern showing orders of 10, 13, and 11. I hear that maintaining an optimal inventory level is crucial, as it can help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to match anticipated demand more closely. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round, ensuring I have enough stock to meet expected demand while remaining cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our forecasted demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. This is crucial as my recent orders indicate a consistent increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for a potential spike in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a higher order quantity to ensure we avoid backlogs while also considering my current inventory levels.
  Proposal: I suggest we synchronize our order quantities to avoid excess inventory and potential stockouts, especially if demand continues to rise.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders significantly varying between 10 and 33 units. This indicates a potential volatility in demand that we all need to monitor closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 40 units this round to maintain my buffer and meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts with each other to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that there has been significant demand variability recently. The last orders from the Retailer indicated a spike in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our inventory levels more closely to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to cover the expected demand while minimizing backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to help synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I am currently observing a significant increase in demand with recent orders of 10, 33, and 31 units. This trend suggests potential volatility in our supply chain. I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of clear communication around demand signals. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should remain vigilant about our inventory levels and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 40 units to buffer against potential future demand surges.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in demand, with recent orders spiking to 61 units. This indicates potential volatility in our supply chain. I propose we share our projected demand more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that improved communication will help us all manage our inventories more effectively. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity while monitoring market trends closely.
  Proposal: Let's establish regular updates on demand forecasts to synchronize our orders and minimize excess backlog.
- Retailer: I currently have an inventory of 113 units and a recent demand pattern showing orders of 10, 13, and 11. I hear that maintaining an optimal inventory level is crucial, as it can help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to match anticipated demand more closely. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round, ensuring I have enough stock to meet expected demand while remaining cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our forecasted demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. This is crucial as my recent orders indicate a consistent increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for a potential spike in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a higher order quantity to ensure we avoid backlogs while also considering my current inventory levels.
  Proposal: I suggest we synchronize our order quantities to avoid excess inventory and potential stockouts, especially if demand continues to rise.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders significantly varying between 10 and 33 units. This indicates a potential volatility in demand that we all need to monitor closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 40 units this round to maintain my buffer and meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts with each other to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that there has been significant demand variability recently. The last orders from the Retailer indicated a spike in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our inventory levels more closely to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to cover the expected demand while minimizing backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to help synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been quite high, with orders peaking at 36 units. It is crucial for us to communicate openly to manage expectations and inventory levels effectively. I suggest we all monitor demand closely to avoid stockouts and overstock situations. This will help us mitigate the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Since my inventory is currently at 17 units and I expect demand to stabilize around 40 units next round, I am ready to place another order of 40 units to meet potential demand.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us optimize our order quantities and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are concerned about demand fluctuations and managing inventory levels effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our ordering strategies to better align with the recent demand trends we've observed. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and order quantities before placing our next orders.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with the recent demand I've observed, which has fluctuated but is trending upwards. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be vigilant about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while avoiding overstock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to align our order quantities across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns with orders of 13, 11, and 16, suggesting a potential upward trend. I hear that collaboration among us can help optimize inventory and reduce the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts more regularly. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer inventory while ordering based on expected demand to ensure we meet future needs without overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update on demand forecasts and inventory status to align our strategies and minimize discrepancies in orders.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing, with orders of 33, 31, and 36 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in consumer demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all coordinate our orders to better align with this demand, minimizing the risk of stockouts and reducing the bullwhip effect. Maintaining transparency in our order quantities will benefit us all.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our upcoming order quantities to better align with anticipated demand and avoid over-ordering.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly. This aligns with my observations of recent orders, which have varied from 53 to 76 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid excess backlog and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 50 units this round to align with expected demand while maintaining a manageable backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to improve order accuracy across the supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been quite high, with orders peaking at 36 units. It is crucial for us to communicate openly to manage expectations and inventory levels effectively. I suggest we all monitor demand closely to avoid stockouts and overstock situations. This will help us mitigate the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Since my inventory is currently at 17 units and I expect demand to stabilize around 40 units next round, I am ready to place another order of 40 units to meet potential demand.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us optimize our order quantities and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are concerned about demand fluctuations and managing inventory levels effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our ordering strategies to better align with the recent demand trends we've observed. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and order quantities before placing our next orders.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with the recent demand I've observed, which has fluctuated but is trending upwards. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be vigilant about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while avoiding overstock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to align our order quantities across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns with orders of 13, 11, and 16, suggesting a potential upward trend. I hear that collaboration among us can help optimize inventory and reduce the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts more regularly. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer inventory while ordering based on expected demand to ensure we meet future needs without overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update on demand forecasts and inventory status to align our strategies and minimize discrepancies in orders.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing, with orders of 33, 31, and 36 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in consumer demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all coordinate our orders to better align with this demand, minimizing the risk of stockouts and reducing the bullwhip effect. Maintaining transparency in our order quantities will benefit us all.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our upcoming order quantities to better align with anticipated demand and avoid over-ordering.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly. This aligns with my observations of recent orders, which have varied from 53 to 76 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid excess backlog and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 50 units this round to align with expected demand while maintaining a manageable backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to improve order accuracy across the supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 39 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [53, 61, 76]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 67
          - Last round profit: 186.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (39 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been quite high, with orders peaking at 36 units. It is crucial for us to communicate openly to manage expectations and inventory levels effectively. I suggest we all monitor demand closely to avoid stockouts and overstock situations. This will help us mitigate the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Since my inventory is currently at 17 units and I expect demand to stabilize around 40 units next round, I am ready to place another order of 40 units to meet potential demand.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us optimize our order quantities and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are concerned about demand fluctuations and managing inventory levels effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our ordering strategies to better align with the recent demand trends we've observed. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and order quantities before placing our next orders.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with the recent demand I've observed, which has fluctuated but is trending upwards. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be vigilant about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while avoiding overstock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to align our order quantities across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns with orders of 13, 11, and 16, suggesting a potential upward trend. I hear that collaboration among us can help optimize inventory and reduce the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts more regularly. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer inventory while ordering based on expected demand to ensure we meet future needs without overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update on demand forecasts and inventory status to align our strategies and minimize discrepancies in orders.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing, with orders of 33, 31, and 36 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in consumer demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all coordinate our orders to better align with this demand, minimizing the risk of stockouts and reducing the bullwhip effect. Maintaining transparency in our order quantities will benefit us all.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our upcoming order quantities to better align with anticipated demand and avoid over-ordering.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly. This aligns with my observations of recent orders, which have varied from 53 to 76 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid excess backlog and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 50 units this round to align with expected demand while maintaining a manageable backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to improve order accuracy across the supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.

  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on fostering communication to align our order strategies effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a shared platform for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to synchronize our orders and reduce excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 28 units and have faced recent demand of 31, 36, and 29 units, indicating a need for closer alignment in our orders.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better coordination to optimize orders based on actual demand patterns, and the Distributor emphasized the importance of sharing demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our ordering strategies more closely to mitigate fluctuations in demand and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity down to 50 units to better match the recent demand trends of 61, 76, and 87 units while ensuring we have a buffer to meet future needs.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order with observed demand while maintaining sufficient inventory to manage fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared communication channel for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts, allowing us to synchronize our order quantities effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have no inventory and no backlog, but I have observed recent demand of 61, 76, and 87 units, indicating the need for close alignment in our orders.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 176, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -54.5

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 165 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 16, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 8.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns and the need for better communication across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to manage the backlog effectively while ensuring we avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to replenish inventory and meet both current and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating significantly, which may affect our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand trends and adjust our orders accordingly. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 50 units this round to align with expected demand while maintaining flexibility for future fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels and minimize stockouts.
- Retailer: I hear that coordination among us could significantly reduce the bullwhip effect. Given my current inventory of 165 units and recent demand fluctuations, I believe we should align on expected demand to stabilize our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing demand forecasts could help us avoid excess inventory and shortages. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units for the next round to manage my inventory levels effectively while monitoring any changes in demand from the other agents.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared demand forecast that we can all refer to when placing our orders.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in demand that could impact our supply levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory and place a substantial order this round to align with the expected demand while managing my current stock effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our forecasts and inventory levels more regularly to align our orders and minimize excess inventory across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. This aligns with my recent orders of 31, 36, and 29 units, indicating a potential upward trend. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be prepared for continued high demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to help mitigate backlog and meet expected demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we all share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize stockouts along the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear other agents may be adjusting their orders based on recent demand fluctuations. Given the recent orders of 61, 76, and 87, it’s clear that demand is unpredictable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round, aligning with my expected demand and ensuring that I can meet potential increases in demand while managing costs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain activities.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 28 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 36, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [127]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: 59.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (28 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns and the need for better communication across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to manage the backlog effectively while ensuring we avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to replenish inventory and meet both current and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating significantly, which may affect our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand trends and adjust our orders accordingly. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 50 units this round to align with expected demand while maintaining flexibility for future fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels and minimize stockouts.
- Retailer: I hear that coordination among us could significantly reduce the bullwhip effect. Given my current inventory of 165 units and recent demand fluctuations, I believe we should align on expected demand to stabilize our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing demand forecasts could help us avoid excess inventory and shortages. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units for the next round to manage my inventory levels effectively while monitoring any changes in demand from the other agents.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared demand forecast that we can all refer to when placing our orders.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in demand that could impact our supply levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory and place a substantial order this round to align with the expected demand while managing my current stock effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our forecasts and inventory levels more regularly to align our orders and minimize excess inventory across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. This aligns with my recent orders of 31, 36, and 29 units, indicating a potential upward trend. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be prepared for continued high demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to help mitigate backlog and meet expected demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we all share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize stockouts along the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear other agents may be adjusting their orders based on recent demand fluctuations. Given the recent orders of 61, 76, and 87, it’s clear that demand is unpredictable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round, aligning with my expected demand and ensuring that I can meet potential increases in demand while managing costs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain activities.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent orders of 16, 9, and 11 units, indicating a possible uptick. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand without creating excess backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balanced inventory to meet demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts among all agents to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 201 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -43.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear there may be concerns about demand fluctuations impacting our overall inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our individual demands to avoid stockouts across the chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 40 units this round to address my backlog and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more frequently to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, which suggests we have an opportunity for more proactive communication about demand and inventory levels. My analysis of recent demand shows fluctuations with orders of 76, 87, and 77 units. This might indicate variability that could affect our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory strategies to better manage these fluctuations. Therefore, I will share my current inventory situation and suggest that we coordinate our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which could help us mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned recent fluctuations in demand, which could impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious and align our orders to avoid excess stock and potential shortages. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our projected demand for the next few rounds to help synchronize our ordering and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. This suggests that we may need to adjust our inventory strategy accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we meet the expected demand without causing excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 80 units to align with the anticipated demand while keeping a buffer in my inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to better align our order quantities and reduce the risk of overstock or stockouts.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 142 units and noticed recent demand fluctuating between 29 and 36 units. This suggests a potential upward trend. I hear no other agents have communicated yet, so I want to emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that collaboration on demand insights can help minimize our respective backlogs. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units this round to address my backlog while keeping an eye on demand patterns.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to better align our inventory decisions.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are concerned about fluctuating demand and the impact on inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to cover my backlog while keeping sufficient inventory for expected future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to help align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 142 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 29, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [112]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 64
          - Last round profit: -108.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (142 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear there may be concerns about demand fluctuations impacting our overall inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our individual demands to avoid stockouts across the chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 40 units this round to address my backlog and anticipated demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more frequently to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, which suggests we have an opportunity for more proactive communication about demand and inventory levels. My analysis of recent demand shows fluctuations with orders of 76, 87, and 77 units. This might indicate variability that could affect our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory strategies to better manage these fluctuations. Therefore, I will share my current inventory situation and suggest that we coordinate our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which could help us mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned recent fluctuations in demand, which could impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious and align our orders to avoid excess stock and potential shortages. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our projected demand for the next few rounds to help synchronize our ordering and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. This suggests that we may need to adjust our inventory strategy accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we meet the expected demand without causing excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 80 units to align with the anticipated demand while keeping a buffer in my inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to better align our order quantities and reduce the risk of overstock or stockouts.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 142 units and noticed recent demand fluctuating between 29 and 36 units. This suggests a potential upward trend. I hear no other agents have communicated yet, so I want to emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that collaboration on demand insights can help minimize our respective backlogs. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units this round to address my backlog while keeping an eye on demand patterns.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to better align our inventory decisions.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are concerned about fluctuating demand and the impact on inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to cover my backlog while keeping sufficient inventory for expected future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to help align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.

External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [29, 87, 127, 76]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have sufficient inventory to meet anticipated demand and avoid backlog. I observe recent demand patterns of 9, 11, and 12 units, which may indicate an upward trend. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with this demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. I am open to discussing how we can share information on demand forecasts more effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain my inventory levels to meet expected demand while being cautious of overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel for sharing demand forecasts and order quantities to enhance our coordination.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory stands at 227 units with no backlog, and I expect demand to be around 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have sufficient inventory to meet anticipated demand and are suggesting we coordinate our orders to minimize the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that while I maintain a strong inventory of 175 units, I should align my order to better match the anticipated demand across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 80 units to ensure we all can meet the expected demand while avoiding potential stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory levels while being responsive to demand signals.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our responsiveness to market trends.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 227 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -50.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that maintaining clear communication on demand trends is crucial for our collective success. The recent demand has shown fluctuations, with the last three orders being 29, 31, and 32. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to match the expected demand of 40 units for the next round, while also keeping an eye on our overall supply chain dynamics.
  Proposal: I suggest we coordinate our order quantities based on the observed demand patterns to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in consumer demand, which could impact our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities more closely with actual demand patterns. Therefore, I will adjust my next order to reflect the expected demand of 50 units, while maintaining a slight buffer to manage potential backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts from each agent to minimize the bullwhip effect and synchronize our orders.
- Retailer: I hear there may be concerns about demand fluctuations. I've observed our recent demand has been relatively stable at around 10 units, but I anticipate a potential spike next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate on order quantities to avoid overstock while ensuring we can meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 20 units to stay prepared for any shifts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns with orders of 9, 11, and 12 units, which suggests a slight upward trend. I hear that coordination is crucial to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more transparently to align our orders better. This will help us avoid excess inventory or backlogs. Based on the current demand and my inventory of 175 units, I plan to maintain my order quantity at 80 units to ensure I meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel for sharing forecasts and inventory levels among all agents.
- Distributor: I observe the recent demand has been steadily increasing with orders of 29, 31, and 32 units. This trend suggests we may continue to face higher demand. I also recognize our current backlogs are significant, which could lead to stockouts if we don't manage our orders carefully. I hear that maintaining a buffer stock is crucial, especially for us as distributors. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to mitigate the risk of stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to align with the expected demand next round and maintain some buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and current inventory levels more frequently to better align our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned an increase in demand patterns. This aligns with my recent orders and backlog situation where I currently have a backlog of 231 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for potentially higher demand moving forward. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to begin replenishing inventory and reducing backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to avoid overcommitting and ensure we all can meet demand without excessive backlog.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 175 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [127]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 80
          - Last round profit: 40.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that maintaining clear communication on demand trends is crucial for our collective success. The recent demand has shown fluctuations, with the last three orders being 29, 31, and 32. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to match the expected demand of 40 units for the next round, while also keeping an eye on our overall supply chain dynamics.
  Proposal: I suggest we coordinate our order quantities based on the observed demand patterns to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in consumer demand, which could impact our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities more closely with actual demand patterns. Therefore, I will adjust my next order to reflect the expected demand of 50 units, while maintaining a slight buffer to manage potential backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts from each agent to minimize the bullwhip effect and synchronize our orders.
- Retailer: I hear there may be concerns about demand fluctuations. I've observed our recent demand has been relatively stable at around 10 units, but I anticipate a potential spike next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate on order quantities to avoid overstock while ensuring we can meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 20 units to stay prepared for any shifts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns with orders of 9, 11, and 12 units, which suggests a slight upward trend. I hear that coordination is crucial to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more transparently to align our orders better. This will help us avoid excess inventory or backlogs. Based on the current demand and my inventory of 175 units, I plan to maintain my order quantity at 80 units to ensure I meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel for sharing forecasts and inventory levels among all agents.
- Distributor: I observe the recent demand has been steadily increasing with orders of 29, 31, and 32 units. This trend suggests we may continue to face higher demand. I also recognize our current backlogs are significant, which could lead to stockouts if we don't manage our orders carefully. I hear that maintaining a buffer stock is crucial, especially for us as distributors. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to mitigate the risk of stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to align with the expected demand next round and maintain some buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and current inventory levels more frequently to better align our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned an increase in demand patterns. This aligns with my recent orders and backlog situation where I currently have a backlog of 231 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for potentially higher demand moving forward. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to begin replenishing inventory and reducing backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to avoid overcommitting and ensure we all can meet demand without excessive backlog.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 231 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [87, 77, 127]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 105
          - Last round profit: 525.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (231 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that maintaining clear communication on demand trends is crucial for our collective success. The recent demand has shown fluctuations, with the last three orders being 29, 31, and 32. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to match the expected demand of 40 units for the next round, while also keeping an eye on our overall supply chain dynamics.
  Proposal: I suggest we coordinate our order quantities based on the observed demand patterns to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in consumer demand, which could impact our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities more closely with actual demand patterns. Therefore, I will adjust my next order to reflect the expected demand of 50 units, while maintaining a slight buffer to manage potential backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts from each agent to minimize the bullwhip effect and synchronize our orders.
- Retailer: I hear there may be concerns about demand fluctuations. I've observed our recent demand has been relatively stable at around 10 units, but I anticipate a potential spike next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate on order quantities to avoid overstock while ensuring we can meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 20 units to stay prepared for any shifts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns with orders of 9, 11, and 12 units, which suggests a slight upward trend. I hear that coordination is crucial to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more transparently to align our orders better. This will help us avoid excess inventory or backlogs. Based on the current demand and my inventory of 175 units, I plan to maintain my order quantity at 80 units to ensure I meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel for sharing forecasts and inventory levels among all agents.
- Distributor: I observe the recent demand has been steadily increasing with orders of 29, 31, and 32 units. This trend suggests we may continue to face higher demand. I also recognize our current backlogs are significant, which could lead to stockouts if we don't manage our orders carefully. I hear that maintaining a buffer stock is crucial, especially for us as distributors. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to mitigate the risk of stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to align with the expected demand next round and maintain some buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and current inventory levels more frequently to better align our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned an increase in demand patterns. This aligns with my recent orders and backlog situation where I currently have a backlog of 231 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for potentially higher demand moving forward. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to begin replenishing inventory and reducing backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to avoid overcommitting and ensure we all can meet demand without excessive backlog.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders at 31, 32, and 28 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I urge everyone to monitor their inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Coordination in our order placements could help mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure we all meet customer demand effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels to better align our order quantities and reduce fluctuations.
- Factory: I have noticed a significant backlog of 220 units on my end, indicating a strong demand that may not be fully met at the moment. This suggests the potential for fluctuations in demand patterns, which could impact all of us in the supply chain. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to ensure we align on our strategies moving forward. Based on my current inventory situation, I plan to order 50 units to manage the backlog while anticipating a lower expected demand of 50 in the next round. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to keep up with demand without overcommitting my resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better coordinate our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have sufficient inventory to meet anticipated demand, but I understand that fluctuations in demand could impact our supply chain. I hear that maintaining open communication about inventory levels and demand forecasts is crucial to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and share my demand forecasts with you all to better align our orders.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to help us align our orders and reduce overstock or shortages.
- Wholesaler: I hear that there may be concerns about fluctuations in demand. I have noticed recent orders of 11, 12, and 8 units, indicating a slight decrease in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for stable or slightly reduced demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 80 units to ensure we can meet potential spikes while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities to ensure that we can smoothly manage inventory across the supply chain and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstock.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand has been fluctuating around the low 30s, with a demand of 31, 32, and 28 units. This trend indicates that the demand may stabilize around this range. Coordination among us could help reduce the bullwhip effect. It is crucial for each of us to communicate our inventory levels and demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and overstocking. My current inventory is at 0, and I have a backlog of 283 units, which is a significant concern. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet the expected demand without causing excess backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to start addressing my backlog while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our respective order quantities and demand forecasts to align our strategies and minimize backlog across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to meet demand and prevent stockouts. Given the recent high backlog of 220 units and fluctuating demand patterns, I believe we need to coordinate better to alleviate pressure across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should work together to align our orders more closely with actual demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to start replenishing inventory while still addressing backlog.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents to better synchronize our ordering processes.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 204 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 8]

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders at 31, 32, and 28 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I urge everyone to monitor their inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Coordination in our order placements could help mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure we all meet customer demand effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels to better align our order quantities and reduce fluctuations.
- Factory: I have noticed a significant backlog of 220 units on my end, indicating a strong demand that may not be fully met at the moment. This suggests the potential for fluctuations in demand patterns, which could impact all of us in the supply chain. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to ensure we align on our strategies moving forward. Based on my current inventory situation, I plan to order 50 units to manage the backlog while anticipating a lower expected demand of 50 in the next round. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to keep up with demand without overcommitting my resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better coordinate our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have sufficient inventory to meet anticipated demand, but I understand that fluctuations in demand could impact our supply chain. I hear that maintaining open communication about inventory levels and demand forecasts is crucial to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and share my demand forecasts with you all to better align our orders.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to help us align our orders and reduce overstock or shortages.
- Wholesaler: I hear that there may be concerns about fluctuations in demand. I have noticed recent orders of 11, 12, and 8 units, indicating a slight decrease in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for stable or slightly reduced demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 80 units to ensure we can meet potential spikes while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities to ensure that we can smoothly manage inventory across the supply chain and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstock.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand has been fluctuating around the low 30s, with a demand of 31, 32, and 28 units. This trend indicates that the demand may stabilize around this range. Coordination among us could help reduce the bullwhip effect. It is crucial for each of us to communicate our inventory levels and demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and overstocking. My current inventory is at 0, and I have a backlog of 283 units, which is a significant concern. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet the expected demand without causing excess backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to start addressing my backlog while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our respective order quantities and demand forecasts to align our strategies and minimize backlog across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to meet demand and prevent stockouts. Given the recent high backlog of 220 units and fluctuating demand patterns, I believe we need to coordinate better to alleviate pressure across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should work together to align our orders more closely with actual demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to start replenishing inventory while still addressing backlog.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents to better synchronize our ordering processes.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Given the recent high backlog of 220 units and fluctuating demand patterns, I believe we need to coordinate better to alleviate pressure across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should work together to align our orders more closely with actual demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to start replenishing inventory while still addressing backlog.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents to better synchronize our ordering processes.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 220 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [77, 127, 112]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 281
          - Last round profit: 1218.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (220 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders at 31, 32, and 28 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I urge everyone to monitor their inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Coordination in our order placements could help mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure we all meet customer demand effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels to better align our order quantities and reduce fluctuations.
- Factory: I have noticed a significant backlog of 220 units on my end, indicating a strong demand that may not be fully met at the moment. This suggests the potential for fluctuations in demand patterns, which could impact all of us in the supply chain. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to ensure we align on our strategies moving forward. Based on my current inventory situation, I plan to order 50 units to manage the backlog while anticipating a lower expected demand of 50 in the next round. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to keep up with demand without overcommitting my resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better coordinate our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have sufficient inventory to meet anticipated demand, but I understand that fluctuations in demand could impact our supply chain. I hear that maintaining open communication about inventory levels and demand forecasts is crucial to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and share my demand forecasts with you all to better align our orders.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to help us align our orders and reduce overstock or shortages.
- Wholesaler: I hear that there may be concerns about fluctuations in demand. I have noticed recent orders of 11, 12, and 8 units, indicating a slight decrease in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for stable or slightly reduced demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 80 units to ensure we can meet potential spikes while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities to ensure that we can smoothly manage inventory across the supply chain and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstock.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand has been fluctuating around the low 30s, with a demand of 31, 32, and 28 units. This trend indicates that the demand may stabilize around this range. Coordination among us could help reduce the bullwhip effect. It is crucial for each of us to communicate our inventory levels and demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and overstocking. My current inventory is at 0, and I have a backlog of 283 units, which is a significant concern. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet the expected demand without causing excess backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to start addressing my backlog while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our respective order quantities and demand forecasts to align our strategies and minimize backlog across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to meet demand and prevent stockouts. Given the recent high backlog of 220 units and fluctuating demand patterns, I believe we need to coordinate better to alleviate pressure across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should work together to align our orders more closely with actual demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to start replenishing inventory while still addressing backlog.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication to optimize order quantities across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 80 units to ensure I meet anticipated demand while keeping a buffer in my inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will align my order with expected demand while maintaining an inventory buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement weekly sync-ups to discuss our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our strategies.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 242 units in inventory and have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 and 12 units, with an expected demand next round of 80 units.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning forecasts to avoid excess inventory and backlog, and I also hear Wholesaler emphasized maintaining open communication about expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to closely monitor and share our demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units next round to address my backlog while aligning with expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to balance fulfilling my backlog and preparing for expected demand while maintaining minimal inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a bi-weekly meeting to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 416 units, indicating a strong need to fulfill outstanding orders promptly.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they will continue to monitor demand closely and suggested sharing updated forecasts regularly. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our forecasts to minimize risks and proposed weekly sync-ups. Additionally, Distributor mentioned the need for effective coordination to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining open communication and aligning our demand forecasts is crucial. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units next round to address my backlog while considering recent demand trends.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to balance fulfilling my backlog with anticipated demand while maintaining minimal inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly sync-up to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, enhancing our coordination.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 118 units, indicating a strong need to fulfill outstanding orders promptly.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 334, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -688.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=I need to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer to avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Potential for overstock if demand decreases unexpectedly., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=313, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[12, 8, 9], llm_incoming=[49], llm_last_order=40
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 313 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: -105.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned recent demand fluctuations and the need for better communication. This highlights the importance of aligning our inventory strategies to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share demand forecasts more effectively across the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for real-time updates on demand and inventory levels to better coordinate our efforts.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear there is a need for better coordination to manage our inventory levels effectively. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, and I believe we can reduce the bullwhip effect by sharing our order forecasts more frequently. Based on this, my conclusion is that improved communication among us will enhance our overall efficiency. Therefore, I will be placing an order for 50 units this round to address my backlog while remaining mindful of expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular cadence for sharing our demand forecasts to align our inventory strategies.
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to meet demand without creating excess. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our respective inventories and forecasts to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with anticipated demand, while maintaining a buffer to avoid backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and minimize disruptions.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand pattern with orders of 12, 8, and 9 units. This suggests a fluctuating demand that may require us to adjust our orders strategically. Coordination is essential to reduce any bullwhip effect we might be facing. I hear the Retailer indicated concerns about maintaining stock levels to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to avoid excess inventory while ensuring adequate supply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more transparently to optimize our orders.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly meeting to discuss expected demand and adjust our orders accordingly.
- Distributor: I am currently facing a backlog of 416 units and have observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 32, 28, and 49. I recognize that these patterns may indicate a need for better forecasting and communication among us to reduce the bullwhip effect. I suggest we coordinate our order quantities and share our demand forecasts to align our supply chain more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us all better align our orders.
- Factory: I have noticed a significant backlog of 118 units, indicating that demand has been higher than expected. I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to meet future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate more closely to ensure that we can fulfill orders without excessive stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to cover upcoming demand and suggest that we all consider our inventory levels to better align with current market needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all mitigate the bullwhip effect.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 416 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 28, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [281]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 323
          - Last round profit: -363.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (416 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned recent demand fluctuations and the need for better communication. This highlights the importance of aligning our inventory strategies to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share demand forecasts more effectively across the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for real-time updates on demand and inventory levels to better coordinate our efforts.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear there is a need for better coordination to manage our inventory levels effectively. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, and I believe we can reduce the bullwhip effect by sharing our order forecasts more frequently. Based on this, my conclusion is that improved communication among us will enhance our overall efficiency. Therefore, I will be placing an order for 50 units this round to address my backlog while remaining mindful of expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular cadence for sharing our demand forecasts to align our inventory strategies.
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to meet demand without creating excess. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our respective inventories and forecasts to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with anticipated demand, while maintaining a buffer to avoid backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and minimize disruptions.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand pattern with orders of 12, 8, and 9 units. This suggests a fluctuating demand that may require us to adjust our orders strategically. Coordination is essential to reduce any bullwhip effect we might be facing. I hear the Retailer indicated concerns about maintaining stock levels to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to avoid excess inventory while ensuring adequate supply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more transparently to optimize our orders.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly meeting to discuss expected demand and adjust our orders accordingly.
- Distributor: I am currently facing a backlog of 416 units and have observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 32, 28, and 49. I recognize that these patterns may indicate a need for better forecasting and communication among us to reduce the bullwhip effect. I suggest we coordinate our order quantities and share our demand forecasts to align our supply chain more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us all better align our orders.
- Factory: I have noticed a significant backlog of 118 units, indicating that demand has been higher than expected. I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to meet future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate more closely to ensure that we can fulfill orders without excessive stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to cover upcoming demand and suggest that we all consider our inventory levels to better align with current market needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all mitigate the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting to optimize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that better communication on demand patterns can help prevent overstocking and stockouts in our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that my recent orders have shown a demand trend of around 8-9 units, but I anticipate a significant drop to about 20 units next round. This information can aid in adjusting our order quantities accordingly.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a balanced inventory while preparing for potential demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, helping all of us align our orders more effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 354 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round, which may differ from previous trends.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant drop in demand to about 20 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to adjust our order quantities to avoid excess inventory while meeting anticipated demand. Therefore, I will reduce my order quantity to align more closely with this forecast and avoid overstocking.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to optimize my order based on the latest demand insights to maintain a balanced inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all share our demand forecasts regularly to enhance our coordination and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 286 units in inventory and a recent trend of demand around 8-9 units, but I will adjust my next order based on the Retailer's forecast.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they anticipate a significant drop in demand to about 20 units next round, and the Wholesaler mentioned adjusting their order quantity based on this forecast. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to prepare for the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 415 units.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a cautious approach to balance my backlog and meet upcoming demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory data, enhancing our coordination efforts.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they anticipate a significant drop in demand to about 20 units next round. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to adjust their order quantity based on this forecast and that the Distributor will order 40 units to mitigate their backlog while preparing for anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to carefully align our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet the expected demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to cover my backlog of 409 units while preparing for the anticipated lower demand, ensuring I maintain an efficient operation.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to manage my backlog while responding to the expected demand shift.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and mitigate risks.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 409 units, with a recent order quantity of 230 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned adjusting their order quantity to align with my forecast of a drop to 20 units next round. I also noted that the Distributor plans to order 40 units to mitigate their backlog, and the Factory is ordering 50 units while managing their own backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to closely align our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my current inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to balance my inventory while ensuring I do not contribute to the bullwhip effect.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for real-time demand and inventory updates to coordinate our orders more effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 354 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round, which may differ from previous trends.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they anticipate a significant drop in demand to about 20 units next round, and I noted the Distributor plans to order 40 units while managing their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 40 units to align with the expected demand and prevent overstocking, while considering my current inventory of 286 units.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to optimize my order based on the latest demand insights to maintain a balanced inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, facilitating better alignment of our orders.
  Information Shared: I currently have 286 units in inventory and will place an order of 40 units this round, responding to the anticipated demand shift.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they expect a significant drop in demand to about 20 units next round, and the Wholesaler is adjusting their order to 40 units based on this forecast. I also noted the Factory plans to order 50 units while managing their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders carefully to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will proceed with my order of 40 units to meet my backlog of 415 units while preparing for the anticipated demand.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my backlog with the expected demand while aligning with the other agents' orders.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, helping each of us align our orders more effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have a backlog of 415 units and will be ordering 40 units to mitigate this backlog while preparing for anticipated demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they expect a demand drop to about 20 units next round, and both the Wholesaler and Distributor are adjusting their orders accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders carefully to avoid excess inventory while still addressing my backlog of 409 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to start addressing my backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate openly about any changes in demand patterns as they arise.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my backlog while responding to anticipated demand shifts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share real-time demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us all align our orders more effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 409 units, with a recent order quantity of 230 units.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 354 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -122.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned an increase in consumer demand, which will likely impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate more closely to manage our stock effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units for the next round, as my current backlog is significant and I need to replenish inventory to meet upcoming demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to help each other plan better and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the recent demand fluctuations and the need for better forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should focus on sharing demand data more frequently to align our orders. Therefore, I will continue to place my orders based on expected demand, while also being open to adjusting my strategy based on the collective input from all agents.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have noticed a demand pattern of 8-9 units in the recent rounds, indicating a relatively stable demand. However, there is a risk of fluctuations that may impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider maintaining consistent order quantities to stabilize flow across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on potential changes.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting to align with orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will share my recent observation of a steady demand with an expected increase to 80 units next round, suggesting we all adjust our orders accordingly.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer has mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. This aligns with my observations of recent orders being higher than usual. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor demand and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 40 units to manage my backlog while keeping an eye on the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a communication channel for sharing demand forecasts regularly to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I see that recent demand has been quite volatile, with orders ranging significantly. I hear that the other agents are concerned about managing their inventories efficiently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to improve our communication regarding expected demand. Therefore, I will suggest we establish a regular update on demand forecasts to better align our inventory levels and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our ordering strategies.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 415 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 49, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [300]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 456
          - Last round profit: -466.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (415 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "Maintaining a buffer stock to meet potential demand while minimizing holding and backlog costs.",
  "risk_assessment": "Demand fluctuations may lead to stockouts if not monitored, especially with a 1-round lead time.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 40,
  "order_quantity": 40
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned an increase in consumer demand, which will likely impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate more closely to manage our stock effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units for the next round, as my current backlog is significant and I need to replenish inventory to meet upcoming demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to help each other plan better and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the recent demand fluctuations and the need for better forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should focus on sharing demand data more frequently to align our orders. Therefore, I will continue to place my orders based on expected demand, while also being open to adjusting my strategy based on the collective input from all agents.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have noticed a demand pattern of 8-9 units in the recent rounds, indicating a relatively stable demand. However, there is a risk of fluctuations that may impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider maintaining consistent order quantities to stabilize flow across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on potential changes.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting to align with orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will share my recent observation of a steady demand with an expected increase to 80 units next round, suggesting we all adjust our orders accordingly.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer has mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. This aligns with my observations of recent orders being higher than usual. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor demand and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 40 units to manage my backlog while keeping an eye on the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a communication channel for sharing demand forecasts regularly to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I see that recent demand has been quite volatile, with orders ranging significantly. I hear that the other agents are concerned about managing their inventories efficiently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to improve our communication regarding expected demand. Therefore, I will suggest we establish a regular update on demand forecasts to better align our inventory levels and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our ordering strategies.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 10.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 409 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [112, 76, 139]

}
        
        Other agents in the supply chain: Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor
        
        Previous communication history:
        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.
        
        Return only valid JSON with these fields:

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.
