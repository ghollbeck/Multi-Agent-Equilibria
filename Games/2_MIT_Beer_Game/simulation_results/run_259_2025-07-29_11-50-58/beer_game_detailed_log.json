I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 70 units to align with the Retailer's strategy. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure we collectively maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain to avoid stockouts. I currently have 210 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, with a profit of 50.0 last round. My general ordering approach is to maintain a buffer while also considering the demand patterns. Therefore, I will schedule production of 70 units this round to align with the expected demand and support the downstream partners.",

Based on recent demand patterns, the mean demand is approximately 10 units. My general ordering approach is to increase my order quantity to clear backlog while ensuring I maintain a buffer for future demand. Therefore, I plan to order 70 units this round to address my backlog and prepare for upcoming demand. I suggest that we coordinate our orders to ensure we collectively maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain, aiming for a target of at least 3 times the mean demand as a buffer. This will help mitigate stockouts and stabilize our operations. I encourage everyone to share their inventory levels and order plans to enhance our coordination.",
