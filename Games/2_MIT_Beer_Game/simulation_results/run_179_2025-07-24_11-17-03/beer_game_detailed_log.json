As the Factory, I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units. My recent profits have been volatile, with a loss of $10.5 last round, but an overall profit of $731.00 so far. To maximize our collective profits, I agree with the Wholesaler's proposal. This will help prevent stockouts and the bullwhip effect, while minimizing holding and backlog costs. Therefore, I will schedule production of 17 units this round to cover my backlog and maintain 1-round of inventory cover. By aligning our strategies in this way, we can stabilize the supply chain and keep everyone profitable.",

My total profit so far is $164.50, but I had a loss of $16 last round due to the high backlog costs. To improve my profitability and avoid further losses, I plan to order 41 units this round to clear my backlog. \n\nHowever, I want to caution that high variability in orders can still destabilize the chain, so I propose we all commit to a 1-round cover target.
