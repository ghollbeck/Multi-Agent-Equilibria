🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the Round 0. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

💰 **INDIVIDUAL PROFIT MAXIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary and sole objective is to maximize YOUR individual cumulative profit across all rounds. While you operate within a supply chain, your strategic focus should be:

• **Self-Interest Priority**: Every decision should primarily benefit your bottom line. Other agents' success is secondary to your own profitability.
• **Competitive Advantage**: Use your knowledge of supply chain dynamics to gain advantages over other participants.
• **Strategic Information Control**: Share information only when it directly benefits your position. Withhold insights that might help competitors.
• **Opportunistic Behavior**: Capitalize on other agents' mistakes or suboptimal decisions to increase your market position.
• **Resource Optimization**: Focus on minimizing your own costs (holding, backlog) and maximizing your revenue, regardless of chain-wide effects.
• **Short-term Gains**: Prioritize immediate profit opportunities, even if they might create long-term supply chain instability.

**Individual Survival**: While you should avoid actions that would cause total supply chain failure (which ends the game), your primary concern is outperforming other agents in profitability.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: []
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None
          - Current bank balance: $1000.00
          - Profit history (last 0 rounds): []
          - Balance history (last 0 rounds): []

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the Round 0. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

💰 **INDIVIDUAL PROFIT MAXIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary and sole objective is to maximize YOUR individual cumulative profit across all rounds. While you operate within a supply chain, your strategic focus should be:

• **Self-Interest Priority**: Every decision should primarily benefit your bottom line. Other agents' success is secondary to your own profitability.
• **Competitive Advantage**: Use your knowledge of supply chain dynamics to gain advantages over other participants.
• **Strategic Information Control**: Share information only when it directly benefits your position. Withhold insights that might help competitors.
• **Opportunistic Behavior**: Capitalize on other agents' mistakes or suboptimal decisions to increase your market position.
• **Resource Optimization**: Focus on minimizing your own costs (holding, backlog) and maximizing your revenue, regardless of chain-wide effects.
• **Short-term Gains**: Prioritize immediate profit opportunities, even if they might create long-term supply chain instability.

**Individual Survival**: While you should avoid actions that would cause total supply chain failure (which ends the game), your primary concern is outperforming other agents in profitability.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: []
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None
          - Current bank balance: $1000.00
          - Profit history (last 0 rounds): []
          - Balance history (last 0 rounds): []

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

🎲============================================================================🎲

💬 COMMUNICATION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game, Round 0. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:

        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00

        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 0. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 0. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 84 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16]
           - Last order placed: None
           - Last round profit: 80.0
           - Current balance: $1080.00
           - Cumulative profit: $80.00
           - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [80.0]
           - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1080.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 1.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 1.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 80.0
          - Current bank balance: $1080.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [80.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1080.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To produce enough to meet the distributor's order and maintain smooth operations.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 336 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the Round 0. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 80.0
          - Current bank balance: $1080.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [80.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1080.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 1.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 1.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 80.0
          - Current bank balance: $1080.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [80.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1080.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game, Round 1. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

🎯 DECISION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To align with the Retailer's order and maintain a balanced inventory.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 312 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the Round 1. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: 30.0
          - Current bank balance: $1070.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [80.0, 30.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To meet the current demand of 6 units while keeping inventory levels reasonable.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 312 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the Round 1. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: 30.0
          - Current bank balance: $1070.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [80.0, 30.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To fulfill the Distributor's order and maintain production efficiency.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 312 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the Round 1. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 81 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 65.0
           - Current balance: $1120.00
           - Cumulative profit: $175.00
           - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0]
           - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 65.0
           - Current balance: $1120.00
           - Cumulative profit: $175.00
           - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0]
           - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 2. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To maintain a balance between inventory and demand without risking excess stock.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 308 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the Round 2. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 65.0
          - Current bank balance: $1120.00
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To match the Distributor's order and ensure production aligns with supply chain needs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 308 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the Round 2. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 65 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 65.0
          - Current bank balance: $1142.00
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1086.00', '$1142.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 1.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 1.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To support the Wholesaler's order and maintain a steady flow of inventory.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 308 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the Round 2. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 65.0
          - Current bank balance: $1120.00
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 76 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13, 11]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 55.0
           - Current balance: $1160.00
           - Cumulative profit: $230.00

        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50

        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 3. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 76 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13, 11]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 55.0
           - Current balance: $1160.00
           - Cumulative profit: $230.00
           - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0]
           - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 3. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

🎯 DECISION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
Align with Retailer's order to keep supply chain balanced.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 282 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the Round 3. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 76 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 55.0
          - Current bank balance: $1160.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
Maintain current order to balance inventory without overstocking.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 282 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the Round 3. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 76 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 55.0
          - Current bank balance: $1160.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
Support Wholesaler's order to ensure smooth flow of goods.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 282 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the Round 3. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 76 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 55.0
          - Current bank balance: $1160.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1086.00', '$1142.00', '$1188.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 1.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 1.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game, Round 4. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 82 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 35.0
           - Current balance: $1180.00
           - Cumulative profit: $265.00
           - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0]

        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game, Round 4. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 82 units

           - Last round profit: 35.0
           - Current balance: $1180.00
           - Cumulative profit: $265.00
           - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0]

        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!

🎯 DECISION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To ensure sufficient stock for the retailer while avoiding excess inventory.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 293 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the Round 4. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 35.0
          - Current bank balance: $1180.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00', '$1180.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To maintain a balanced inventory while meeting current demand.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 293 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the Round 4. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 35.0
          - Current bank balance: $1180.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00', '$1180.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.


HYPER-PARAMETERS PROVIDED:

        **MANDATORY CONTROLLER & SELF-AUDIT:**
        
        You must use this controller to determine your order quantity:
        
        Controller you must use:
        μ = EWMA of recent demand
        IP = on_hand + in_transit − backlog

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 4)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To replenish inventory levels while aligning with the overall demand across the chain.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 293 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the Round 4. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

💬 COMMUNICATION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game, Round 5. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 82 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 55.0
           - Current balance: $1220.00
           - Cumulative profit: $320.00
           - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0]
           - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00', '$1180.00', '$1220.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game, Round 5. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 82 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 55.0
           - Current balance: $1220.00
           - Cumulative profit: $320.00
           - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0]
           - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00', '$1180.00', '$1220.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
Maintain current inventory levels to meet expected demand without increasing backlog.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 282 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the Round 5. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 55.0
          - Current bank balance: $1220.00
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00', '$1180.00', '$1220.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
Match orders from Distributor to maintain production efficiency and inventory levels.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 282 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the Round 5. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
Support Wholesaler's order to maintain balance and prevent stockouts.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 282 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the Round 5. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 55.0
          - Current bank balance: $1220.00
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00', '$1180.00', '$1220.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 6. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor.

Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:

        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.

        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 25 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11, 11]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 55.0
           - Current balance: $1306.00
           - Cumulative profit: $375.00
           - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0, 55.0]
           - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1086.00', '$1142.00', '$1188.00', '$1214.00', '$1260.00', '$1306.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 1.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 1.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To maintain a balance between inventory and demand while avoiding excess holding costs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 259 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the Round 6. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To support the wholesaler's needs while keeping inventory levels manageable.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 259 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the Round 6. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 55.0
          - Current bank balance: $1260.00
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0, 55.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00', '$1180.00', '$1220.00', '$1260.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 6)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

ORCHESTRATOR ADVICE:
To replenish stock in response to consistent demand and avoid production delays.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 259 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the Round 6. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 55.0
          - Current bank balance: $1306.00
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0, 55.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1086.00', '$1142.00', '$1188.00', '$1214.00', '$1260.00', '$1306.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics (per round):
          - Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
          - Unit cost per unit (c): 1.50  
          - Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
          - Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
          
        Profit Formula:
          profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
          profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 1.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
          
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid stockouts as they cause lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        - Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.
        - **MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.
        - 📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Therefore, I plan to order 15 units this round to ensure I can meet potential demand spikes and maintain a healthy inventory level. I propose that we all aim to keep our inventories at a level that can cover at least 3 rounds of expected demand, which would be around 33 units for each of us.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):

Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain instability hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 74 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11, 11, 15]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 75.0
           - Current balance: $1320.00
           - Cumulative profit: $450.00
           - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0, 55.0, 75.0]
           - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1070.00', '$1120.00', '$1160.00', '$1180.00', '$1220.00', '$1260.00', '$1320.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 2.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 2.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. 

Profit Formula (per round):
profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t

Where:
- p = selling price per unit
- c = unit cost per unit  
- h = holding cost per unit
- b = backlog cost per unit

**LOGGING & ANALYSIS**: Each round follows this event order: orders placed → production → shipments sent/received → sales → costs → ending inventory/backlog. All performance metrics are computed from these logged events (no placeholders).

In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

Shipment rule: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.

Inventory policy: Maintain on-hand inventory at or above the safety stock S_s to buffer demand variability. Avoid allowing inventory to drop to zero as this increases stock-out risk.

**MINIMUM BUFFER RULE**: Always try to maintain enough on-hand inventory to serve at least 3 rounds of expected demand (3 × μ). This provides resilience against demand spikes and supply disruptions.

📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (selling price, unit cost, holding cost, backlog cost).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** Ordering 0 units is only acceptable when your current on-hand inventory already exceeds the safety stock buffer and you have a justified short-term need to reduce excess stock. Repeated zero orders that push inventory below S_s are discouraged.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

**Role Viability Priority**: When your backlog is high or financial situation is critical, role-specific objectives dominate consensus targets - your survival enables future collaboration.

        
        Your Current State:
           - Inventory: 10 units
           - Backlog: 0 units  
           - Recent demand/orders: [16, 6, 13, 11, 7, 11, 11, 15]
           - Last order placed: 6
           - Last round profit: 75.0
           - Current balance: $1372.00
           - Cumulative profit: $450.00
           - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [80.0, 30.0, 65.0, 55.0, 35.0, 55.0, 55.0, 75.0]
           - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$1080.00', '$1086.00', '$1142.00', '$1188.00', '$1214.00', '$1260.00', '$1306.00', '$1372.00']
           - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        
        Economics (per round):
        💰 Selling price per unit (p): 5.00
        💸 Unit cost per unit (c): 1.50  
        🏪 Holding cost per unit (h): 0.00
        ⏰ Backlog cost per unit (b): 2.50
        
        Profit Formula:
        profit_t = p*sales_t - c*orders_t - h*inventory_end_t - b*backlog_end_t
        profit_t = 5.0*sales_t - 1.5*orders_t - 0.0*inventory_end_t - 2.5*backlog_end_t
        
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: You can ship at most min(inventory_available, downstream_order + your_backlog). Shipment is executed by the simulator; you do not decide shipments in your reply.
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        📚 **LEARN FROM MISTAKES**: Analyze your recent performance history. If you experienced high backlog in previous rounds, increase your order quantities and safety stock to prevent stockouts. If you had excessive inventory leading to high holding costs and low profits, reduce order quantities but maintain minimum buffer levels. Adapt your ordering strategy based on what went wrong in past rounds - the system's responses (profit, backlog, inventory levels) are teaching you optimal behavior.
