--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Orders received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $5.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, and I plan to order 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will ensure that my order to the Distributor aligns with the Retailer's needs while maintaining my inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I will order strategically to balance my inventory and support the Retailer's demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable by sharing our demand forecasts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $5.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will place an order to the Factory that reflects the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory levels in check to avoid excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and share our demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $5.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with the anticipated demand to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to prevent any potential stockouts or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $5.00 so far.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $5.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $5.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will ensure that my order to the Distributor aligns with the Retailer's needs while maintaining my inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable by sharing our demand forecasts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will place an order to the Factory that reflects the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory levels in check to avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and share our demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with the anticipated demand to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to prevent any potential stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current profit is $-3.00, and I have 36 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our collective demand forecasts to minimize the risk of stock-outs and holding costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 36 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. This is crucial as my current profit is $57.00, and I have 16 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent fluctuations that could lead to excess inventory or stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we do not face stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to create a joint strategy that minimizes risks and maximizes our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between supply and demand to avoid backlog costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our collective demand forecasts to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or facing stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which highlights the urgency of our coordination to prevent further backlog costs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units is critical. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or facing stock-outs, as this will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current profit is $-3.00, and I have 36 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [60]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $13.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 7 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (7 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $13.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet the expected demand while avoiding excessive backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that our production and ordering strategies are synchronized to meet demand effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excessive backlog costs.

          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (40 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $13.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet the expected demand while avoiding excessive backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that our production and ordering strategies are synchronized to meet demand effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 2. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 40, 10]

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have 49 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $8.50, and I have 49 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 5 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $196.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 55 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid potential market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $81.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 55 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain. Distributor mentioned the risk of not meeting demand due to their backlog of 55 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog and expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing enough to cover backlog and expected demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 49 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 13, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 5 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 13, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have 49 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 55 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain. Distributor mentioned the risk of not meeting demand due to their backlog of 55 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog and expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 55 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [24, 26, 35]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [90]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (55 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have 49 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 55 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain. Distributor mentioned the risk of not meeting demand due to their backlog of 55 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog and expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have 49 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 55 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in our supply chain. Distributor mentioned the risk of not meeting demand due to their backlog of 55 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog and expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 64 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to minimize the risk of stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $4.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently zero.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must be cautious about our inventory levels and backlog to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain a steady flow of inventory across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the need to reduce backlog while considering future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $210.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, which is currently 16 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure sufficient stock without overcommitting, and Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of inventory across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on minimizing backlog while ensuring timely supply to the Wholesaler.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 60 units, which affects my ability to ship. My current profit is $66.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends, and Distributor echoed the importance of stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient stock while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 95 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent further backlog and maintain profitability.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing enough to cover backlog while being mindful of future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our production and order quantities based on the recent demand trends to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 95 units, which affects my ability to ship. My current profit is $282.50.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 64 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends, and Distributor echoed the importance of stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient stock while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 95 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent further backlog and maintain profitability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have 64 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.

- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must be cautious about our inventory levels and backlog to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain a steady flow of inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 60 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [26, 35, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 85
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (60 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 64 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to minimize the risk of stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must be cautious about our inventory levels and backlog to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain a steady flow of inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure sufficient stock without overcommitting, and Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends, and Distributor echoed the importance of stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient stock while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 95 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent further backlog and maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our production and order quantities based on the recent demand trends to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 95 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 40, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [125]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 70
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (95 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 64 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to minimize the risk of stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must be cautious about our inventory levels and backlog to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain a steady flow of inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure sufficient stock without overcommitting, and Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends, and Distributor echoed the importance of stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient stock while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 95 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent further backlog and maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our production and order quantities based on the recent demand trends to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 87 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $-9.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 87 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $-9.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the Retailer's recent demand trends while managing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a consistent ordering strategy that reflects our collective demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid supply chain disruptions.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $298.00, with 0 units in inventory and 8 units in backlog, which affects my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 30 units, which limits my ability to fulfill downstream orders. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and keep our supply chain stable, ultimately maximizing our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the Wholesaler's backlog and the Retailer's demand trends while managing my own backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a consistent ordering strategy that reflects our collective demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid supply chain disruptions.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 30 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could impact the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing our demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 131 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could threaten my profit of $436.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or backlog.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 87 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 30 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [35, 15, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [140]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 86
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (30 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 87 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $-9.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a consistent ordering strategy that reflects our collective demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid supply chain disruptions.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 30 units, which limits my ability to fulfill downstream orders. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and keep our supply chain stable, ultimately maximizing our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a consistent ordering strategy that reflects our collective demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid supply chain disruptions.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing our demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 131 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could threaten my profit of $436.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a consistent production strategy that reflects our collective demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid supply chain disruptions.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 131 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 30, 90]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [221]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 125
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (131 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 87 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $-9.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a consistent ordering strategy that reflects our collective demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid supply chain disruptions.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 30 units, which limits my ability to fulfill downstream orders. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and keep our supply chain stable, ultimately maximizing our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a consistent ordering strategy that reflects our collective demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid supply chain disruptions.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing our demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 131 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could threaten my profit of $436.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a consistent production strategy that reflects our collective demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid supply chain disruptions.

• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 92 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-30.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I have 92 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $-30.50.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 2 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $367.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. My current profit is $329.50, but I am facing a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which threatens my profit trajectory. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 28 units.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $1059.50, but I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1 unit, which threatens my profit trajectory. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits, and I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. Let's work together to maintain stability in our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning production with expected demand while managing backlog and inventory levels.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 92 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits, and I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. Let's work together to maintain stability in our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits, and I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. Let's work together to maintain stability in our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 90, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 221
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 127 units and a backlog of 0 units. My profit so far is $-81.50, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs as demand fluctuates, and I propose we align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Information Shared: Current inventory: 127 units, Backlog: 0 units, Total profit: $-81.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the Retailer's needs without incurring backlog costs. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $372.00. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders to reflect recent demand patterns and maintain a steady flow of inventory to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: Current inventory: 75 units, Backlog: 0 units, Total profit: $372.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without incurring backlog costs. However, I am concerned about fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $454.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: Current inventory: 75 units, Backlog: 0 units, Total profit: $454.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 320 units and no backlog, I can support our supply chain effectively. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $1204.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to maintain a steady flow of inventory and prevent stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 127 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 10, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 75 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 10, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [65]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 127 units and a backlog of 0 units. My profit so far is $-81.50, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs as demand fluctuates, and I propose we align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the Retailer's needs without incurring backlog costs. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $372.00. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to reflect recent demand patterns and maintain a steady flow of inventory to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without incurring backlog costs. However, I am concerned about fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $454.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 320 units and no backlog, I can support our supply chain effectively. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $1204.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to maintain a steady flow of inventory and prevent stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 75 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 28, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [122]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 56
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 127 units and a backlog of 0 units. My profit so far is $-81.50, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs as demand fluctuates, and I propose we align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the Retailer's needs without incurring backlog costs. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $372.00. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to reflect recent demand patterns and maintain a steady flow of inventory to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without incurring backlog costs. However, I am concerned about fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $454.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 320 units and no backlog, I can support our supply chain effectively. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $1204.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to maintain a steady flow of inventory and prevent stock-outs.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 127 units and a backlog of 0 units. My profit so far is $-81.50, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs as demand fluctuates, and I propose we align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the Retailer's needs without incurring backlog costs. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $372.00. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to reflect recent demand patterns and maintain a steady flow of inventory to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without incurring backlog costs. However, I am concerned about fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $454.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 320 units and no backlog, I can support our supply chain effectively. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $1204.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to maintain a steady flow of inventory and prevent stock-outs.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 141 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-117.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I have 141 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $-117.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while being cautious of future demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 91 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $411.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordinated orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. I currently have 271 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $454.00. However, we must be cautious of future demand fluctuations and the risk of stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while coordinating closely with others.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 141 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 5, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 141 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-117.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordinated orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. I currently have 271 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $454.00. However, we must be cautious of future demand fluctuations and the risk of stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 91 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 5, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 271 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 17, 34]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [82]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 141 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-117.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordinated orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. I currently have 271 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $454.00. However, we must be cautious of future demand fluctuations and the risk of stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for coordinated orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. I currently have 339 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $1240.00. However, we must be cautious of future demand fluctuations and the risk of stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 339 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [50, 65, 54]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 65
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 141 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-117.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordinated orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. I currently have 271 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $454.00. However, we must be cautious of future demand fluctuations and the risk of stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 152 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $-178.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 130 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $411.50. It's crucial that we all manage our orders carefully to avoid fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will continue to order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 152 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 14, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 347 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 34, 26]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [74]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 395 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [65, 54, 46]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 54
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 152 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-178.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 130 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $411.50. It's crucial that we all manage our orders carefully to avoid fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.

    LLM Communication Output: {"message": "I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of managing orders carefully to avoid fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 395 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $1227.50. It's crucial that we all communicate our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:
