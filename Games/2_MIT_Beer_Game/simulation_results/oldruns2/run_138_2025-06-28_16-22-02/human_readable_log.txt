Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-1.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on current demand while considering future fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $-1.00.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial for all of us to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on current demand while considering future fluctuations to maintain a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is at $-1.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordinated orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective needs, while being mindful of my current profit situation, which is at $-1.00.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer while fulfilling orders to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is at $-1.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordinated orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to prevent excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on expected demand while maintaining a balance to avoid excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-1.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-1.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial for all of us to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordinated orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective needs, while being mindful of my current profit situation, which is at $-1.00.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordinated orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to prevent excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our collective demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $17.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to ensure I can meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory stable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, and I plan to order 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Therefore, I will ensure that my order to the Distributor aligns with the Retailer's needs while considering my current inventory of 29 units and no backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow, maximizing our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, and I am focused on maintaining profitability while meeting demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to ensure steady inventory levels, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders while keeping a buffer for future demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure we can meet the expected demand without risking stock-outs or excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a balance between fulfilling demand and avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory and demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
  Information Shared: I have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, and I plan to order 20 units this round to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to ensure steady inventory levels, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production with the expected demand to maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $17.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to ensure I can meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory stable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Therefore, I will ensure that my order to the Distributor aligns with the Retailer's needs while considering my current inventory of 29 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow, maximizing our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to ensure steady inventory levels, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders while keeping a buffer for future demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure we can meet the expected demand without risking stock-outs or excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory and demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to ensure steady inventory levels, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production with the expected demand to maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $17.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to ensure I can meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory stable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Therefore, I will ensure that my order to the Distributor aligns with the Retailer's needs while considering my current inventory of 29 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow, maximizing our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to ensure steady inventory levels, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders while keeping a buffer for future demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure we can meet the expected demand without risking stock-outs or excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory and demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to ensure steady inventory levels, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production with the expected demand to maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 26 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and avoid excess holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $31.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $31.50, and I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten this profit. To maximize our collective profits, I propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain open communication about our inventory levels. This will help us avoid stockouts and excess holding costs, ensuring a stable supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0. Let's work together to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 26 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and avoid excess holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $31.50, and I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten this profit. To maximize our collective profits, I propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain open communication about our inventory levels. This will help us avoid stockouts and excess holding costs, ensuring a stable supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0. Let's work together to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $31.50. I propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain open communication about our inventory levels. This will help us avoid stockouts and excess holding costs, ensuring a stable supply chain for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the recent demand trends while keeping my inventory at 18 units and no backlog. This will help us avoid stockouts and excess holding costs, ensuring a stable supply chain for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and production quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.

          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 26 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and avoid excess holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $31.50, and I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten this profit. To maximize our collective profits, I propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain open communication about our inventory levels. This will help us avoid stockouts and excess holding costs, ensuring a stable supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0. Let's work together to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $31.50.

  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the recent demand trends while keeping my inventory at 18 units and no backlog. This will help us avoid stockouts and excess holding costs, ensuring a stable supply chain for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and production quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects both current demand and potential fluctuations, while keeping in mind my inventory of 27 units and zero backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $48.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to manage demand fluctuations effectively. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for clear communication regarding our inventory levels and expected demand to prevent excess inventory or backlog, which could threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while being cautious about ordering too much to avoid holding costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game, Round 3. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [13, 11, 12]

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects both current demand and potential fluctuations, while keeping in mind my inventory of 27 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to manage demand fluctuations effectively. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for clear communication regarding our inventory levels and expected demand to prevent excess inventory or backlog, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely to manage demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects the recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential increases, considering my current inventory of 27 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely to manage demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at 6 units and no backlog. This will help prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and ordering strategies accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects both current demand and potential fluctuations, while keeping in mind my inventory of 27 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to manage demand fluctuations effectively. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for clear communication regarding our inventory levels and expected demand to prevent excess inventory or backlog, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely to manage demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects the recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential increases, considering my current inventory of 27 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely to manage demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at 6 units and no backlog. This will help prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and ordering strategies accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects both current demand and potential fluctuations, while keeping in mind my inventory of 27 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to manage demand fluctuations effectively. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for clear communication regarding our inventory levels and expected demand to prevent excess inventory or backlog, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely to manage demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects the recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential increases, considering my current inventory of 27 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely to manage demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at 6 units and no backlog. This will help prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and ordering strategies accordingly to minimize risks of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $65.00 and an inventory of 26 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 11-12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 11-12 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordinated orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will suggest we all consider the recent demand trends of 11-12 units and plan our orders accordingly to avoid fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a steady order quantity based on recent demand while managing my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable, ensuring we all avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordinated orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends of 11-12 units to avoid excess stock and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the current backlog and expected demand to maintain balance.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends and ensures we all avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which affects my ability to meet downstream demand and could lead to stock-outs if not addressed.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).

Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 11-12 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordinated orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will suggest we all consider the recent demand trends of 11-12 units and plan our orders accordingly to avoid fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable, ensuring we all avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordinated orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends of 11-12 units to avoid excess stock and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $65.00 and an inventory of 26 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 11-12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 11-12 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordinated orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will suggest we all consider the recent demand trends of 11-12 units and plan our orders accordingly to avoid fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable, ensuring we all avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordinated orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends of 11-12 units to avoid excess stock and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends and ensures we all avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 6 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (6 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $65.00 and an inventory of 26 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 11-12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 11-12 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordinated orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will suggest we all consider the recent demand trends of 11-12 units and plan our orders accordingly to avoid fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable, ensuring we all avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordinated orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends of 11-12 units to avoid excess stock and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends and ensures we all avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $88.00, and I have 24 units in inventory with no backlog. However, I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
  Information Shared: I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 24 units and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. We should consider a joint strategy to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer in inventory while coordinating orders to prevent fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and ensure steady product flow.
  Information Shared: I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. I also note that the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our profits.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders effectively to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $38.50. If we do not address this, we risk stock-outs that could destabilize our profits. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain profitability and avoid costly excess stock or backlog.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 24 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 12, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $88.00, and I have 24 units in inventory with no backlog. However, I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 24 units and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. We should consider a joint strategy to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and ensure steady product flow.

If we do not address this, we risk stock-outs that could destabilize our profits. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 24 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 12, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $88.00, and I have 24 units in inventory with no backlog. However, I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 24 units and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. We should consider a joint strategy to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and ensure steady product flow.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. I also note that the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and ensure steady product flow.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders effectively to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $38.50. If we do not address this, we risk stock-outs that could destabilize our profits. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain profitability and avoid costly excess stock or backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and ensure steady product flow.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 12, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $88.00, and I have 24 units in inventory with no backlog. However, I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 24 units and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. We should consider a joint strategy to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and ensure steady product flow.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. I also note that the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and ensure steady product flow.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders effectively to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to forecast demand accurately and coordinate our order quantities to maximize total supply chain profits while minimizing holding and backlog costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $38.50. If we do not address this, we risk stock-outs that could destabilize our profits. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain profitability and avoid costly excess stock or backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and ensure steady product flow.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $88.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 14, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 14, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 14, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 34
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $96.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on future fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand while maintaining sufficient inventory to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Information Shared: I have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, and I will be ordering 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are coordinated to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while fulfilling demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $96.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts or oversupply, especially since I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the expected demand while maintaining a buffer for future fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to align with the Wholesaler's and Retailer's needs while managing my inventory effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without risking stockouts or excessive holding costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $109.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. The Distributor also plans to order 20 units to ensure they can meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I need to be cautious about overproduction while ensuring I can fulfill these orders. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the total expected demand while considering my backlog and shipment constraints.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet the total expected demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without risking stockouts or excessive holding costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, with a total profit of $58.50 so far.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 6, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 6, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $96.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on future fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are coordinated to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts or oversupply, especially since I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the expected demand while maintaining a buffer for future fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without risking stockouts or excessive holding costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. The Distributor also plans to order 20 units to ensure they can meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I need to be cautious about overproduction while ensuring I can fulfill these orders. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the total expected demand while considering my backlog and shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without risking stockouts or excessive holding costs.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $96.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on future fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are coordinated to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts or oversupply, especially since I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the expected demand while maintaining a buffer for future fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without risking stockouts or excessive holding costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. The Distributor also plans to order 20 units to ensure they can meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I need to be cautious about overproduction while ensuring I can fulfill these orders. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the total expected demand while considering my backlog and shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without risking stockouts or excessive holding costs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $109.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain flow.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $109.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and ensure a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and demand forecasts to maintain a stable supply chain flow. I currently have 9 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $132.00. If we do not manage our orders carefully, we risk stockouts that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our strategies to maintain a stable supply chain flow. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1 unit, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production and inventory levels, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs that could hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 9 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $109.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and ensure a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and demand forecasts to maintain a stable supply chain flow. I currently have 9 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $132.00. If we do not manage our orders carefully, we risk stockouts that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our strategies to maintain a stable supply chain flow. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1 unit, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production and inventory levels, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs that could hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $109.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and ensure a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and demand forecasts to maintain a stable supply chain flow. I currently have 9 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $132.00. If we do not manage our orders carefully, we risk stockouts that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our strategies to maintain a stable supply chain flow. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1 unit, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production and inventory levels, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs that could hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $125.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to match the recent demand trends of 10, 11, and 12 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to match the expected demand and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Sharing our forecasts can help us stabilize the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer in my inventory while responding to the Retailer's demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand of 10, 11, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.
  Information Shared: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders to avoid costs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions. My current inventory is 17 units with no backlog, and I have a profit of $153.50. I am concerned about potential stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively, as my shipment constraints allow me to ship only what is ordered plus my backlog. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels and shipment constraints.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand of 10, 11, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.
  Information Shared: I currently have 17 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders to avoid costs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules closely to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. My current inventory is at 0 units with a backlog of 3 units, which puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions and ensure that we can meet the expected demand of 10, 11, and 12 units without creating excess stock or further backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the expected demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units, which requires careful planning to avoid stock-outs and additional costs.

- Retailer: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $125.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to match the recent demand trends of 10, 11, and 12 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to match the expected demand and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Sharing our forecasts can help us stabilize the supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 17 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $125.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to match the recent demand trends of 10, 11, and 12 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to match the expected demand and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Sharing our forecasts can help us stabilize the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand of 10, 11, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions. My current inventory is 17 units with no backlog, and I have a profit of $153.50. I am concerned about potential stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively, as my shipment constraints allow me to ship only what is ordered plus my backlog. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand of 10, 11, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules closely to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. My current inventory is at 0 units with a backlog of 3 units, which puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions and ensure that we can meet the expected demand of 10, 11, and 12 units without creating excess stock or further backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 3 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [3]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (3 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $125.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to match the recent demand trends of 10, 11, and 12 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to match the expected demand and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. Sharing our forecasts can help us stabilize the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand of 10, 11, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions. My current inventory is 17 units with no backlog, and I have a profit of $153.50. I am concerned about potential stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively, as my shipment constraints allow me to ship only what is ordered plus my backlog. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand of 10, 11, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules closely to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. My current inventory is at 0 units with a backlog of 3 units, which puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions and ensure that we can meet the expected demand of 10, 11, and 12 units without creating excess stock or further backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory or backlog.

--------------------- Round 11 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Orders received per agent: [9, 9, 9, 9]
Shipments received per agent: [11, 11, 20, 1]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 29 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $133.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. This means I need to be cautious with my orders to avoid any disruptions.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer while being cautious with my orders to avoid backlog costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and inventory levels to ensure we meet customer demand without causing disruptions.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $133.50, my inventory is 29 units, and I have no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. The Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together closely to optimize our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we meet customer needs without risking stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid backlog costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory levels and demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and prevent any disruptions.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $162.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 11 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting demand, which could lead to further backlog costs and impact my profit of $113.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, ensuring we maximize our total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce enough to cover the backlog while being cautious of future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our production and ordering strategies based on our current inventory and demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow and prevent any disruptions.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which limits my ability to ship. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to avoid stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 29 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our supply chain.

The Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together closely to optimize our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we meet customer needs without risking stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory levels and demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and prevent any disruptions.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 11 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting demand, which could lead to further backlog costs and impact my profit of $113.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, ensuring we maximize our total profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [1]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 29 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends and inventory levels to ensure we meet customer demand without causing disruptions.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. The Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together closely to optimize our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we meet customer needs without risking stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory levels and demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and prevent any disruptions.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 11 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting demand, which could lead to further backlog costs and impact my profit of $113.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, ensuring we maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and ordering strategies based on our current inventory and demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow and prevent any disruptions.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $137.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively. My current profit stands at $137.00, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but we must be cautious about future orders to avoid excess inventory or stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $137.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively. My current profit stands at $137.00, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but we must be cautious about future orders to avoid excess inventory or stock-outs. I propose that we all share our upcoming demand forecasts to optimize our order quantities and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, which will help maximize our collective profits and prevent any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand, but I must be cautious about future orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively, ensuring we maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively, ensuring we maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $137.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively. My current profit stands at $137.00, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but we must be cautious about future orders to avoid excess inventory or stock-outs. I propose that we all share our upcoming demand forecasts to optimize our order quantities and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, which will help maximize our collective profits and prevent any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand, but I must be cautious about future orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively, ensuring we maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively, ensuring we maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 23
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 11. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [12, 9, 8]
          - Last order placed: 23
          - Total profit so far: $97.00
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

  "risk_assessment": "Potential risk of overproduction if demand decreases unexpectedly, leading to higher holding costs.",
  "d_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($97.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (16 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $161.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand and affects our overall supply chain stability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory, which could threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $161.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand and affects our overall supply chain stability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory, which could threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $161.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts effectively and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand and affects our overall supply chain stability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory, which could threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 21 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.

- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for effective coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 18 units, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and order quantities. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits. My current profit is $107.50, and I need to balance production to meet demand while minimizing backlog costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 21 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 5 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for effective coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 18 units, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and order quantities. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits. My current profit is $107.50, and I need to balance production to meet demand while minimizing backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 18 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [18]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (18 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for effective coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 18 units, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and order quantities. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt our profits. My current profit is $107.50, and I need to balance production to meet demand while minimizing backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $206.50 and an inventory of 23 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet demand while minimizing costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 23 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady inventory is crucial to avoid stock-outs and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to align with the recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to mitigate risks of fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet demand while minimizing costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 23 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet the anticipated demand while avoiding excessive inventory that could lead to increased holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's order while maintaining a buffer for future demand.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current backlog of 11 units and zero inventory, I am at risk of not being able to meet future demand effectively. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent orders of 20 units from each of you to ensure we all align and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 23 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 14, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent orders of 20 units from each of you to ensure we all align and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which will help maximize our total profits and prevent stock-outs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 3 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 14, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $206.50 and an inventory of 23 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.

- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet the anticipated demand while avoiding excessive inventory that could lead to increased holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's order while maintaining a buffer for future demand. I currently have 3 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to ship more than the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. It's crucial that we all communicate our order quantities and forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Let's work together to maximize our total profits and avoid any risks of stockouts or oversupply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 14, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $206.50 and an inventory of 23 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady inventory is crucial to avoid stock-outs and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to align with the recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to mitigate risks of fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet the anticipated demand while avoiding excessive inventory that could lead to increased holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's order while maintaining a buffer for future demand. I currently have 3 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to ship more than the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. It's crucial that we all communicate our order quantities and forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Let's work together to maximize our total profits and avoid any risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current backlog of 11 units and zero inventory, I am at risk of not being able to meet future demand effectively. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent orders of 20 units from each of you to ensure we all align and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which will help maximize our total profits and prevent stock-outs.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly.
  Information Shared: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $215.00, and I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet actual demand while maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly to prevent fluctuations that could threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to maintain a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly.
  Information Shared: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $215.00, and I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely to meet actual demand while maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 10 units and no backlog, highlighting that I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This means I need to be cautious with my order to the Factory to avoid stockouts. I propose we coordinate our expected demand and current inventory levels to prevent fluctuations that could threaten our profits. We should also consider the holding and backlog costs that affect our profit margins, as excessive inventory or stockouts can lead to losses for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the recent demand trends while keeping a close eye on my inventory levels to maintain a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate closely to align our production and orders to meet actual demand while maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which means I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This constraint highlights the importance of accurate forecasting and timely orders to prevent stockouts. My current profit is $183.00, and I am concerned that any misalignment could threaten our profit trajectories. Let's work together to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs, as this will benefit all of us in the long run.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet the expected demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly to ensure we can coordinate our orders and production effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which limits my shipping capacity. My total profit so far is $183.00.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet actual demand while maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly to prevent fluctuations that could threaten our profits.

- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely to meet actual demand while maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 10 units and no backlog, highlighting that I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This means I need to be cautious with my order to the Factory to avoid stockouts. I propose we coordinate our expected demand and current inventory levels to prevent fluctuations that could threaten our profits. We should also consider the holding and backlog costs that affect our profit margins, as excessive inventory or stockouts can lead to losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate closely to align our production and orders to meet actual demand while maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which means I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This constraint highlights the importance of accurate forecasting and timely orders to prevent stockouts. My current profit is $183.00, and I am concerned that any misalignment could threaten our profit trajectories. Let's work together to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs, as this will benefit all of us in the long run.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand and current inventory levels regularly to ensure we can coordinate our orders and production effectively.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate closely to align our production and orders to meet actual demand while maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2 units, which means I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This constraint highlights the importance of accurate forecasting and timely orders to prevent stockouts. My current profit is $183.00, and I am concerned that any misalignment could threaten our profit trajectories. Let's work together to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs, as this will benefit all of us in the long run.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($183.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (2 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $218.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on future fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand while maintaining sufficient inventory to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Information Shared: I have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, and I will be ordering 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are coordinated to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's order.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
  Information Shared: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $218.50 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and Wholesaler mentioned the need to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to align with the Wholesaler's needs while maintaining a buffer for future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
  Information Shared: I currently have 22 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $286.50 so far.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $218.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on future fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are coordinated to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and Wholesaler mentioned the need to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and Wholesaler mentioned the need to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Distributor also stated they will place an order of 20 units to ensure they can meet the Wholesaler's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 1 unit and no backlog, as excess stock could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 22 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $218.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on future fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are coordinated to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and Wholesaler mentioned the need to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and Wholesaler mentioned the need to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Distributor also stated they will place an order of 20 units to ensure they can meet the Wholesaler's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 1 unit and no backlog, as excess stock could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.

- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are coordinated to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to keep a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to align with recent demand trends, and Wholesaler mentioned the need to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my current inventory of 37 units and the recent demand trends to ensure we all stay profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my current inventory of 37 units and the recent demand trends to ensure we all stay profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to reflect recent demand trends while considering our current inventory and backlog situations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply, ensuring a steady flow in the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to reflect recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all stay profitable and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will focus on scheduling production to meet the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 2 units and zero inventory. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [3]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my current inventory of 37 units and the recent demand trends to ensure we all stay profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to reflect recent demand trends while considering our current inventory and backlog situations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply, ensuring a steady flow in the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to reflect recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all stay profitable and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will focus on scheduling production to meet the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 2 units and zero inventory. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my current inventory of 37 units and the recent demand trends to ensure we all stay profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to reflect recent demand trends while considering our current inventory and backlog situations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply, ensuring a steady flow in the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to reflect recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all stay profitable and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will focus on scheduling production to meet the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 2 units and zero inventory. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $229.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on our overall supply chain stability.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand without risking stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid potential losses. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to ensure I can meet the Retailer's demand while keeping my inventory stable and avoiding backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while aligning with expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand without risking stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure we can all meet demand without risking stock-outs or excessive inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to match the Wholesaler's order and maintain a buffer for future demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to align with the Wholesaler's order while maintaining a buffer for future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand without risking stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 15 units while considering the recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet current backlog while monitoring demand closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 5, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $229.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on our overall supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid potential losses. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to ensure I can meet the Retailer's demand while keeping my inventory stable and avoiding backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure we can all meet demand without risking stock-outs or excessive inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to match the Wholesaler's order and maintain a buffer for future demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 15 units while considering the recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 5, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $229.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on our overall supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid potential losses. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to ensure I can meet the Retailer's demand while keeping my inventory stable and avoiding backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure we can all meet demand without risking stock-outs or excessive inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to match the Wholesaler's order and maintain a buffer for future demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 15 units while considering the recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 15 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 5, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (15 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $229.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on our overall supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid potential losses. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to ensure I can meet the Retailer's demand while keeping my inventory stable and avoiding backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure we can all meet demand without risking stock-outs or excessive inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to match the Wholesaler's order and maintain a buffer for future demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 15 units while considering the recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $237.50 and an inventory of 28 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.

  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 28 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. I currently have a profit of $237.50, an inventory of 28 units, and no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and ensure a stable supply chain flow, while being mindful of the risks of stockouts and oversupply that could threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid potential market instability. Therefore, I will focus on scheduling production to meet the current backlog of 22 units while being mindful of the recent demand trends to prevent excess stock and holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet the backlog and anticipated demand while avoiding overproduction.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 22 units, which highlights the urgency of our situation and the need for coordinated efforts to prevent stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 22 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [22]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (22 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $237.50 and an inventory of 28 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. I currently have a profit of $237.50, an inventory of 28 units, and no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and ensure a stable supply chain flow, while being mindful of the risks of stockouts and oversupply that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid potential market instability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid potential market instability. Therefore, I will focus on scheduling production to meet the current backlog of 22 units while being mindful of the recent demand trends to prevent excess stock and holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain flow and maximize our collective profits.

• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $232.00 and an inventory of 36 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 36 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping my inventory levels in check.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 36 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a balance between fulfilling orders and managing inventory levels to avoid excessive holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable, while being mindful of our shipment constraints.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 21 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand effectively. My total profit so far is $309.50, and I want to ensure we all avoid stockouts that could hurt our profits.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure a steady flow of products. My current profit is $181.00, but with a backlog of 12 units and no inventory, I am at risk of stock-outs if we do not synchronize our efforts. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my backlog and meet expected demand, while urging everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on my backlog and expected demand while coordinating with others.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which highlights the urgency of our coordination efforts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $232.00 and an inventory of 36 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 31
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $232.00 and an inventory of 36 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable, while being mindful of our shipment constraints.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure a steady flow of products. My current profit is $181.00, but with a backlog of 12 units and no inventory, I am at risk of stock-outs if we do not synchronize our efforts. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my backlog and meet expected demand, while urging everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my current inventory of 35 units and the recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 5, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 5, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my current inventory of 35 units and the recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will focus on placing orders that align with recent demand trends while keeping my inventory at a manageable level to prevent excess holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects my current inventory of 13 units and the recent demand trends while ensuring I can fulfill the Wholesaler's needs without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and no backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet anticipated demand while being cautious of overproduction to avoid excess holding costs. I encourage everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my current inventory of 35 units and the recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and no backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet anticipated demand while being cautious of overproduction to avoid excess holding costs. I encourage everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 21. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [9, 5, 10]
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Total profit so far: $236.00
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

  "risk_assessment": "Potential risk of overproduction if demand decreases unexpectedly, leading to higher holding costs.",
  "d_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $252.50, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. However, I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory. To maintain stability, we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can maximize our total supply chain profits and prevent any collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and emphasized the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer in my inventory while coordinating closely with the Retailer and Distributor to manage demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Information Shared: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. My profit stands at $252.50, and I am concerned about the impact of holding and backlog costs on our overall profitability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and emphasized the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler agrees on the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory buffers. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive inventory, which could threaten our profits. My current profit stands at $347.00, and I have 17 units in inventory with no backlog. We need to coordinate our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid any potential market collapse that would hurt all of us.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $252.50, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. However, I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory. To maintain stability, we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can maximize our total supply chain profits and prevent any collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and emphasized the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and emphasized the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler agrees on the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory buffers. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive inventory, which could threaten our profits. My current profit stands at $347.00, and I have 17 units in inventory with no backlog. We need to coordinate our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid any potential market collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor agree on the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory buffers. My current profit stands at $263.00, and I have only 1 unit in inventory with no backlog. This situation puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive inventory, which could threaten our profits. We need to coordinate our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid any potential market collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 17 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $252.50, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. However, I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory. To maintain stability, we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can maximize our total supply chain profits and prevent any collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and emphasized the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and emphasized the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler agrees on the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory buffers. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive inventory, which could threaten our profits. My current profit stands at $347.00, and I have 17 units in inventory with no backlog. We need to coordinate our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid any potential market collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor agree on the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory buffers. My current profit stands at $263.00, and I have only 1 unit in inventory with no backlog. This situation puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive inventory, which could threaten our profits. We need to coordinate our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid any potential market collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $252.50, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. However, I am concerned about potential demand fluctuations that could threaten my profit trajectory. To maintain stability, we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can maximize our total supply chain profits and prevent any collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and emphasized the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and emphasized the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler agrees on the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory buffers. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive inventory, which could threaten our profits. My current profit stands at $347.00, and I have 17 units in inventory with no backlog. We need to coordinate our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid any potential market collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential demand fluctuations and the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor agree on the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory buffers. My current profit stands at $263.00, and I have only 1 unit in inventory with no backlog. This situation puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive inventory, which could threaten our profits. We need to coordinate our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid any potential market collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our upcoming orders based on recent demand trends to prevent any potential market collapse.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $245.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I have 35 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $245.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $245.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels and shipment constraints.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $339.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 3 units and zero inventory, which limits my ability to ship more than the downstream order plus backlog. We need to ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce based on the current backlog and expected demand to maintain balance.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $245.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 3 units and zero inventory, which limits my ability to ship more than the downstream order plus backlog. We need to ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [1]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $245.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 3 units and zero inventory, which limits my ability to ship more than the downstream order plus backlog. We need to ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 3 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [3]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (3 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $245.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 3 units and zero inventory, which limits my ability to ship more than the downstream order plus backlog. We need to ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $249.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. It's crucial that we coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. If we don't align our strategies, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and maintain supply chain stability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $249.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $249.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and maintain supply chain stability, as any misalignment could lead to oversupply or stock-outs, threatening our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid backlog costs.

Therefore, I will share that I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $343.50. I propose we all communicate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent oversupply or stock-outs, which could destabilize our profits. We must be cautious of the risks associated with stockouts and holding costs, as they can significantly impact our margins. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid backlog costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and maintain supply chain stability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $343.50.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $243.00. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while considering the shipment constraints that allow me to ship only the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. This will help us avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which could destabilize our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $249.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. It's crucial that we coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. If we don't align our strategies, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $249.00.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $243.00. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while considering the shipment constraints that allow me to ship only the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. This will help us avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which could destabilize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and maintain supply chain stability.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

Shipments received per agent: [4, 4, 1, 3]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 33 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $252.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, and I am focused on maximizing my profit of $252.50 while ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand patterns to ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which could lead to stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $252.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $348.50. If we don't align our orders, we risk stockouts or excess inventory, which could hurt all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 30 units, and I have no backlog. My profit so far is $348.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 17 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate our production and orders. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which could lead to stockouts or excess inventory that hurts our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the expected demand while managing my backlog to avoid excess stock.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 33 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, and I am focused on maximizing my profit of $252.50 while ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand patterns to ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which could lead to stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $348.50. If we don't align our orders, we risk stockouts or excess inventory, which could hurt all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 17 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate our production and orders. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which could lead to stockouts or excess inventory that hurts our profits.

Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 33 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, and I am focused on maximizing my profit of $252.50 while ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand patterns to ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which could lead to stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $348.50. If we don't align our orders, we risk stockouts or excess inventory, which could hurt all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 17 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate our production and orders. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and ensure we meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which could lead to stockouts or excess inventory that hurts our profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 17 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 9, 8]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (17 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($225.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (17 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $261.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $261.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $363.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $232.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our collective inventory levels to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to ensure we are all coordinated and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 20 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $261.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $363.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $232.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our collective inventory levels to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to ensure we are all coordinated and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $363.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $232.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our collective inventory levels to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to ensure we are all coordinated and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $271.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $271.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. We must be cautious of demand fluctuations that could threaten our profits and lead to instability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 13 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $382.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits while being cautious of demand fluctuations that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand and affects our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce to cover the backlog and align with the recent demand trends to prevent any further stock-outs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 13 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $271.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $271.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. We must be cautious of demand fluctuations that could threaten our profits and lead to instability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 13 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $382.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits while being cautious of demand fluctuations that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand and affects our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce to cover the backlog and align with the recent demand trends to prevent any further stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities based on the recent demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 8 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $271.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $271.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. We must be cautious of demand fluctuations that could threaten our profits and lead to instability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 13 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $382.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits while being cautious of demand fluctuations that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand and affects our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce to cover the backlog and align with the recent demand trends to prevent any further stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities based on the recent demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $287.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand without immediate risk of stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect recent demand trends while considering our inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we all agree on a joint order strategy that stabilizes our supply chain and maximizes profits for everyone involved.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a steady flow of orders while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 13 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders while maintaining a buffer for future demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we all agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends while considering our inventory levels to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the current backlog and expected demand to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid excess stock.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $287.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect recent demand trends while considering our inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we all agree on a joint order strategy that stabilizes our supply chain and maximizes profits for everyone involved.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 13 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $287.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect recent demand trends while considering our inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we all agree on a joint order strategy that stabilizes our supply chain and maximizes profits for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we all agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends while considering our inventory levels to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid excess stock.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 18
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $287.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect recent demand trends while considering our inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we all agree on a joint order strategy that stabilizes our supply chain and maximizes profits for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we all agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand trends while considering our inventory levels to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on the recent demand of 10, 10, and 12 units to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid excess stock.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet customer needs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand patterns while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand without overstocking, which can lead to increased holding costs.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 25 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $307.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to ensure we all have sufficient inventory while minimizing holding costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to maintain a buffer while being mindful of the recent demand trends.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand patterns while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet potential fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which can lead to increased costs for all of us.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 25 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $307.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to ensure sufficient inventory while minimizing holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with the recent demand trends while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet potential fluctuations, keeping in mind that I currently have 17 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand patterns while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which can lead to increased costs for all of us. We should also share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 17 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $429.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our production and inventory levels to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 10 units while being mindful of the recent demand trends to avoid excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet the backlog and anticipated demand while avoiding overproduction.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and production schedules to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand without incurring excess holding costs.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, with a total profit of $298.00.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet customer needs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand without overstocking, which can lead to increased holding costs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet customer needs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand without overstocking, which can lead to increased holding costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to ensure we all have sufficient inventory while minimizing holding costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to maintain a buffer while being mindful of the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which can lead to increased costs for all of us.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to ensure sufficient inventory while minimizing holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with the recent demand trends while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet potential fluctuations, keeping in mind that I currently have 17 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which can lead to increased costs for all of us. We should also share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our production and inventory levels to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 10 units while being mindful of the recent demand trends to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our orders and production schedules to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand without incurring excess holding costs.

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:
