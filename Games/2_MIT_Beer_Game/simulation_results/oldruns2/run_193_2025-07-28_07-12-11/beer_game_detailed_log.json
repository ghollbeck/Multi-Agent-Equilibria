I made a profit of $31.9 last round, and my total profit so far is $250.50. I want to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable supply chain to maximize our collective profits.

I encourage the Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory to also plan their orders/production accordingly to keep the supply chain flowing smoothly.

I'm currently profitable, with $284.60 in total earnings so far. However, I'm concerned that high inventory levels are eating into my profits through holding costs. To improve the overall supply chain, I propose that we all aim for a 1-round inventory cover - that is, each stage should hold just enough to meet the next round's expected demand. This will minimize holding costs while still providing reliable service to customers. I'm willing to order 8 units this round to work towards this goal.
