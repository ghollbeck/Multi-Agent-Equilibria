--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to meet demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all aim to keep our stock levels balanced to avoid backlogs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to prepare for the expected demand increase.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining stock levels to meet potential demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 98 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we should aim to keep our stock levels balanced to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match expected demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to prepare for the anticipated increase in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet potential demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 98 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we should all aim to keep our stock levels balanced to avoid backlogs. I also heard Wholesaler echo this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the expected demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain sufficient inventory while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining stock levels to meet anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 98 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of maintaining balanced stock levels to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all coordinate our orders to align with the expected demand to minimize fluctuations. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand increases while ensuring we are prepared for any changes.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue sharing our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 106, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 12, Profit: 60.00, Total Profit: 18.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=To avoid stockouts and meet expected demand, I will order enough to cover both current and anticipated needs., risk_assessment=Demand may increase unexpectedly, leading to potential backlog if not enough stock is ordered., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=98, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[12], llm_incoming=[12], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "Demand may fluctuate, leading to potential backlog if not enough stock is ordered.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to meet demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all aim to keep our stock levels aligned with expected demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to prepare for potential increases in demand while ensuring I have enough inventory to avoid backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively stable, with a current order of 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to prepare for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a cautious approach to my ordering strategy to ensure we can meet this demand without overextending our inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Factory: I have observed that the recent demand is 12 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend that we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Coordination in our ordering can help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain stock while anticipating potential demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to meet demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all aim to keep our stock levels aligned with expected demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to prepare for potential increases in demand while ensuring I have enough inventory to avoid backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively stable, with a current order of 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to prepare for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a cautious approach to my ordering strategy to ensure we can meet this demand without overextending our inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Factory: I have observed that the recent demand is 12 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend that we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Coordination in our ordering can help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.

--------------------- Round 2 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 15
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 12 and 15 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a proactive ordering strategy to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to keep inventory levels healthy and avoid backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we all share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 12 and 15 units and plan to order 20 units to maintain inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory healthy.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain stock levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 73 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 12 and 15 units and plan to order 20 units to maintain inventory. I also note the Wholesaler's caution about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our order quantities to align with the expected demand while avoiding stockpiling. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory levels and meet potential demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to keep my inventory healthy and meet demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we all share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 53 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 12 and 15 units and plan to order 20 units. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's caution about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our order quantities to align with the expected demand while maintaining healthy inventory levels. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure we can meet potential demand without overextending our resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a balanced order quantity to meet demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient stock.
  Information Shared: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 101, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 15, Units sold: 15, Profit: 75.00, Total Profit: 67.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=15, confidence=0.8, rationale=To cover expected demand and maintain a buffer, I will order 15 units., risk_assessment=Demand may exceed expectations, leading to potential backlog if not enough stock is ordered., expected_demand_next_round=15, llm_inventory=101, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[12, 15], llm_incoming=[35], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 7.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand.",

  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 12 and 15 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a proactive ordering strategy to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity this round to balance our stock levels while being prepared for potential demand spikes.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a significant spike in orders. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough buffer for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 12 and 15 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a proactive ordering strategy to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity this round to balance our stock levels while being prepared for potential demand spikes.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a significant spike in orders. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough buffer for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [12, 12, 12, 32]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock and prepare for potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, my recent demand has been 12, 15, and 9 units, indicating a potential increase in demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider the recent demand trends of 12, 15, and 9 units, which suggest a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on adjusting my order based on observed demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My recent demand has been consistent, and I currently have 71 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned adjusting orders based on observed demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider the recent demand fluctuations and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory while anticipating demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and recent trends to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My recent demand has been 12, 35, and 24 units, indicating a potential increase in demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned adjusting orders based on observed demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider the recent demand fluctuations and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my production capacity while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining production capacity while anticipating demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and recent trends to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 14 units and no inventory, indicating a need for timely production to meet demand.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory and prepare for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders peaking at 35 units. This suggests potential volatility in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to balance our stock levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, with orders jumping from 12 to 55 and then 49. This suggests potential volatility in demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be adjusting my order quantity to better align with expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our order forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to better align our supply chain responses.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 71 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 15, 9]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: 33.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory and prepare for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders peaking at 35 units. This suggests potential volatility in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to balance our stock levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, with orders jumping from 12 to 55 and then 49. This suggests potential volatility in demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be adjusting my order quantity to better align with expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our order forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to better align our supply chain responses.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [45]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 64.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 15, 9, and 5 units. I hear that maintaining stock levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a recent spike in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increases in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without incurring high holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 24 and 35 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand without incurring excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 15, 9, and 5 units. I hear that maintaining stock levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a recent spike in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increases in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without incurring high holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 24 and 35 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand without incurring excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 116 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 5, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 49.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 9, 5, and 14 units. I hear that maintaining stock levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory for potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a spike in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increased orders in the coming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet any sudden demand.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without excessive holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 24 and 34 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 45 and 54 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 9, 5, and 14 units. I hear that maintaining stock levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory for potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a spike in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increased orders in the coming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet any sudden demand.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without excessive holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 24 and 34 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 45 and 54 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 132 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 14, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 42.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders ranging from 5 to 14 units. This suggests potential variability in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match actual demand and reduce excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 5, 14, and 9 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should consider. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential spikes while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 25, 34, and 29 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 45 and 54 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Let's share our expected demand to better align our orders.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 123 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [45, 54, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: 96.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders ranging from 5 to 14 units. This suggests potential variability in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match actual demand and reduce excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 5, 14, and 9 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should consider. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential spikes while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 25, 34, and 29 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 45 and 54 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Let's share our expected demand to better align our orders.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 160 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 9, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 34.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 14, 9, and 6 units. I hear that maintaining stock levels is crucial to avoid backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand trends. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 34, 29, and 26 units. This suggests a potential downward trend in demand. I recommend we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid excess stock and holding costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with this trend.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 54, 49, 46. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to maintain a buffer while being mindful of potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with the observed demand trends and avoid overstocking.

          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: 78.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 14, 9, and 6 units. I hear that maintaining stock levels is crucial to avoid backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand trends. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 34, 29, and 26 units. This suggests a potential downward trend in demand. I recommend we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid excess stock and holding costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with this trend.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 54, 49, 46. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to maintain a buffer while being mindful of potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with the observed demand trends and avoid overstocking.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our inventory and demand patterns. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels to prevent any shortages.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 6 and 9 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we are prepared for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around the mid-20s. This suggests a potential for increased demand in the upcoming rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we have enough stock to meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain a moderate order quantity to balance inventory levels and avoid excess holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around the mid-40s. This suggests a potential for consistent ordering patterns. I encourage everyone to share their current inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared inventory data to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our supply chain.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 6, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 20.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our inventory and demand patterns. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels to prevent any shortages.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 6 and 9 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we are prepared for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around the mid-20s. This suggests a potential for increased demand in the upcoming rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we have enough stock to meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain a moderate order quantity to balance inventory levels and avoid excess holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around the mid-40s. This suggests a potential for consistent ordering patterns. I encourage everyone to share their current inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared inventory data to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our inventory and demand patterns. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels to prevent any shortages.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 6 and 9 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we are prepared for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around the mid-20s. This suggests a potential for increased demand in the upcoming rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we have enough stock to meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain a moderate order quantity to balance inventory levels and avoid excess holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around the mid-40s. This suggests a potential for consistent ordering patterns. I encourage everyone to share their current inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared inventory data to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 6, 9, and 13 units. I hear that maintaining stock levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand trends. Therefore, I will order 20 units to prepare for potential increases in demand while keeping my inventory healthy.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a spike in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increases in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a proactive ordering strategy to ensure we have enough stock to meet demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to align with potential demand shifts.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 37 to 49 units. This suggests potential variability in future orders. I recommend we coordinate our ordering to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. By sharing our expected demand, we can reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize excess inventory.

- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 37 to 49 units. This suggests potential variability in future orders. I recommend we coordinate our ordering to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. By sharing our expected demand, we can reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize excess inventory.

--------------------- Round 10 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [29, 49, 79, 98]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 9, 13, and 13 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to avoid backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain stock levels and prepare for any increase in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without creating backlogs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 301 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that recent demand has been fluctuating and emphasized the importance of maintaining sufficient inventory to avoid backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand.

  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without creating backlogs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 226 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that recent demand has been fluctuating and emphasized the importance of maintaining sufficient inventory to avoid backlog. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand while avoiding overstocking. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock levels and prepare for any increase in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain stock while being mindful of potential demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without creating backlogs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 266 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of maintaining sufficient inventory to avoid backlog due to fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand while avoiding overstocking. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for any unexpected demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without creating backlogs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 290 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 301 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -77.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet this demand without delays.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 29, 22, and 33 units. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units this round to maintain stock while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 49, 37, and 53 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to avoid overreacting to these fluctuations, which can lead to excess inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to avoid backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain stock levels and prepare for any increase in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet this demand without delays.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 29, 22, and 33 units. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units this round to maintain stock while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 49, 37, and 53 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to avoid overreacting to these fluctuations, which can lead to excess inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 266 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 22, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [83]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -20.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 290 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [49, 37, 53]

        Other agents in the supply chain: Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor
        
        Previous communication history:
        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.
        
        Return only valid JSON with these fields:
        
        {
          "message": "<your message to other agents>",
          "strategy_hint": "<brief hint about your approach>", 
          "collaboration_proposal": "<specific proposal for working together>",
          "information_shared": "<key information you're willing to share>",
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>
        }
        
        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, no markdown, no code fences. Keep it concise.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.
