External demand (Retailer): 8
Orders received per agent: [8, 8, 8, 8]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1.00, and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk a collapse in the supply chain, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on observed demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities each round to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1.00, and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities each round to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 42, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 8, Units sold: 8, Profit: 20.00, Total Profit: -1.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=8, confidence=0.9, rationale=I have enough inventory to meet the expected demand and avoid stock-outs., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, but current inventory levels are sufficient., expected_demand_next_round=8, llm_inventory=42, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8], llm_incoming=[8], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk a collapse in the supply chain, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that accurate demand predictions are crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 32 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $8.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand but also highlights the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. I propose we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and maximize our profits. If we don't, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on current inventory and expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $32.00, and I have 24 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current orders but requires careful planning for future demand.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that accurate demand predictions are crucial for avoiding stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 4 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill large orders. I am currently at a profit of $92.00, but if we do not align our strategies, we risk stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $92.00, and I have 4 units in inventory with no backlog, which limits my shipping capacity to the Wholesaler.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said that accurate demand predictions are crucial for avoiding stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 4 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits, as my current profit is $98.00 and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [18]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 24 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that accurate demand predictions are crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 32 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand but also highlights the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. I propose we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and maximize our profits. If we don't, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that accurate demand predictions are crucial for avoiding stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 4 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill large orders. I am currently at a profit of $92.00, but if we do not align our strategies, we risk stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that accurate demand predictions are crucial for avoiding stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 4 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits, as my current profit is $98.00 and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.

  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand but also highlights the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. I propose we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and maximize our profits. If we don't, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that accurate demand predictions are crucial for avoiding stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 4 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill large orders. I am currently at a profit of $92.00, but if we do not align our strategies, we risk stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that accurate demand predictions are crucial for avoiding stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for careful planning to avoid future shortages. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 4 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits, as my current profit is $98.00 and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [8, 38]
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Total profit so far: $98.00
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",
  "risk_assessment": "The main risk is overproducing if demand fluctuates unexpectedly, leading to higher holding costs.",
  "d_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Orders received per agent: [12, 12, 32, 12]
Shipments received per agent: [8, 8, 8, 28]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a balance is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 8, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Information Shared: My total profit so far is $24.00, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a balance is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 8, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 8, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the risk of not fulfilling future orders due to having no inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more closely to ensure we can meet the upcoming demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order quantity that reflects the recent demand of 8, 18, and 32 units, ensuring we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler mentioned the risk of not fulfilling future orders due to having no inventory. Additionally, the Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production schedules based on the recent demand trends and current backlogs across the chain to maximize our collective profits and prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy that reflects the recent demand of 8, 38, and 12 units, ensuring we can meet upcoming demand without oversupplying.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 30 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 18, 32]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (30 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a balance is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 8, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 8, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the risk of not fulfilling future orders due to having no inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more closely to ensure we can meet the upcoming demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order quantity that reflects the recent demand of 8, 18, and 32 units, ensuring we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler mentioned the risk of not fulfilling future orders due to having no inventory. Additionally, the Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production schedules based on the recent demand trends and current backlogs across the chain to maximize our collective profits and prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy that reflects the recent demand of 8, 38, and 12 units, ensuring we can meet upcoming demand without oversupplying.

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a balance is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 8, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand of 8, 10, and 12 units to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer demand without oversupplying. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the risk of not fulfilling future orders due to having no inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more closely to ensure we can meet the upcoming demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order quantity that reflects the recent demand of 8, 18, and 32 units, ensuring we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler mentioned the risk of not fulfilling future orders due to having no inventory. Additionally, the Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production schedules based on the recent demand trends and current backlogs across the chain to maximize our collective profits and prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy that reflects the recent demand of 8, 38, and 12 units, ensuring we can meet upcoming demand without oversupplying.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 38 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $25.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently zero.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand, but I must be cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting, as this will help maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Distributor's backlog of 16 units is concerning, as it indicates a risk of not meeting demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting, as this will help maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.

- Retailer: I currently have 38 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 20 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [18, 32, 18]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [70]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 38 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand, but I must be cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting, as this will help maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.
- Factory: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Distributor's backlog of 16 units is concerning, as it indicates a risk of not meeting demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting, as this will help maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and production schedules to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [38, 12, 42]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 38 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand, but I must be cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting, as this will help maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all stages.
- Factory: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Distributor's backlog of 16 units is concerning, as it indicates a risk of not meeting demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting, as this will help maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 15 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand but poses a risk if demand increases unexpectedly. My profit so far is $182.00, and I want to ensure we all maintain profitability. I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 15 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is $182.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which means I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $205.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 15 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts, and Distributor emphasized the need for collaboration to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which limits my ability to fulfill downstream orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow and prevent excessive costs. It's crucial to consider that my current profit is $462.00, and any misalignment could threaten our collective profitability.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our production with shared demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 63 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 15 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 18, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [58]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (15 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 6 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 42, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 38
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (6 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 63 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand effectively. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 15 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand but poses a risk if demand increases unexpectedly. My profit so far is $182.00, and I want to ensure we all maintain profitability. I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which means I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts, and Distributor emphasized the need for collaboration to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which limits my ability to fulfill downstream orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow and prevent excessive costs. It's crucial to consider that my current profit is $462.00, and any misalignment could threaten our collective profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-17.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but puts pressure on future orders if demand fluctuates.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but puts pressure on future orders if demand fluctuates. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current orders but requires careful planning for future demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on a collective understanding of demand, as I currently have 11 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. We need to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure that our decisions do not lead to stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt all our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to minimize risks and maximize profits.
  Information Shared: I have 11 units in inventory and no backlog, which means I can only ship what is ordered plus any backlog. My total profit so far is $347.50, and I want to maintain this trajectory.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for coordination to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 20 units, but I urge everyone to share their expected demand for the next round to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on current backlog while seeking alignment on future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and production schedules.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 7, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 7, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [59]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-17.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but puts pressure on future orders if demand fluctuates. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on a collective understanding of demand, as I currently have 11 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. We need to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure that our decisions do not lead to stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to minimize risks and maximize profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for coordination to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 20 units, but I urge everyone to share their expected demand for the next round to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and production schedules.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-17.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but puts pressure on future orders if demand fluctuates. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on a collective understanding of demand, as I currently have 11 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. We need to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure that our decisions do not lead to stock-outs or oversupply, which would hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to minimize risks and maximize profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for coordination to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 20 units, but I urge everyone to share their expected demand for the next round to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and production schedules.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [42, 28, 59]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 34
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 5. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [42, 28, 59]

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 82 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-28.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 82 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but also highlights the need for careful order planning.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 41 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill immediate demand but also highlights the need for careful order planning to avoid stockouts. My total profit so far is $255.00, and I want to ensure that our decisions do not threaten this trajectory.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 4, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 41 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 4, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 82 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-28.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 41 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill immediate demand but also highlights the need for careful order planning to avoid stockouts. My total profit so far is $255.00, and I want to ensure that our decisions do not threaten this trajectory. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of careful order planning to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady inventory levels across the chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a stable supply and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, emphasizing careful order planning. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady inventory levels across the chain. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 2 units and anticipate future demand while being cautious of overproduction.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 39 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 24, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [68]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 82 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-28.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 41 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill immediate demand but also highlights the need for careful order planning to avoid stockouts. My total profit so far is $255.00, and I want to ensure that our decisions do not threaten this trajectory. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of careful order planning to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady inventory levels across the chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a stable supply and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, emphasizing careful order planning. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady inventory levels across the chain. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 2 units and anticipate future demand while being cautious of overproduction.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 82 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-28.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 41 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill immediate demand but also highlights the need for careful order planning to avoid stockouts. My total profit so far is $255.00, and I want to ensure that our decisions do not threaten this trajectory. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of careful order planning to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady inventory levels across the chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a stable supply and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and maintain steady inventory levels across the chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, emphasizing careful order planning. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady inventory levels across the chain. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 2 units and anticipate future demand while being cautious of overproduction.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 12, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [24, 20, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [62]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 98 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-57.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid drastic fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent drastic fluctuations and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent drastic fluctuations and maintain stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on recent demand trends to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while preventing excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [59, 30, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 32
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 114 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 119 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 20, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 114 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-104.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment about aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for better coordination to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules and order quantities to reflect actual demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to ensure we do not create unnecessary holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 95 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 40, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 114 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-104.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.

  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for better coordination to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules and order quantities to reflect actual demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to ensure we do not create unnecessary holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate better to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-153.50, and I have 128 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 128 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate better to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow is crucial for all of us. I currently have 108 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $269.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on recent demand trends and share forecasts to minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover potential demand fluctuations while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 108 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of maintaining a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have a stable supply and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 135 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate better to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard Wholesaler and Distributor echo the importance of maintaining a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and orders to prevent fluctuations that could threaten our profits. I currently have 109 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have a stable supply and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 128, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 8, Units sold: 6, Profit: 15.00, Total Profit: -153.5

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 128 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate better to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-153.50, and I have 128 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate better to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow is crucial for all of us. I currently have 108 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $269.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on recent demand trends and share forecasts to minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of maintaining a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have a stable supply and minimize costs across the supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 109 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 28, 46]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-192.50, which is concerning. I have 133 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet demand effectively. However, I am aware that fluctuations in demand could lead to stock-outs if not anticipated correctly. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which would help stabilize our profits across the supply chain. We need to be cautious about the potential for market instability, as it could hurt all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 133 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit trajectory is negative, which threatens my ability to meet future demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuations in demand and the potential for stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 117 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am aware that if we do not align our orders, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. Let's work together to forecast demand accurately and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer in inventory while coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent market instability.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuations in demand and the potential for stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs, which could threaten all of our profits. I currently have 144 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $547.00. To maintain this trajectory, we need to carefully consider our order quantities and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 133 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 117 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-192.50, which is concerning. I have 133 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet demand effectively. However, I am aware that fluctuations in demand could lead to stock-outs if not anticipated correctly. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which would help stabilize our profits across the supply chain. We need to be cautious about the potential for market instability, as it could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuations in demand and the potential for stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 117 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am aware that if we do not align our orders, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. Let's work together to forecast demand accurately and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuations in demand and the potential for stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs, which could threaten all of our profits. I currently have 144 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $547.00. To maintain this trajectory, we need to carefully consider our order quantities and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuations in demand and the potential for stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be cautious about our production and ordering strategies to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. I currently have 108 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $1191.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 144 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 26, 19]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [59]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-192.50, which is concerning. I have 133 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet demand effectively. However, I am aware that fluctuations in demand could lead to stock-outs if not anticipated correctly. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which would help stabilize our profits across the supply chain. We need to be cautious about the potential for market instability, as it could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuations in demand and the potential for stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 117 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am aware that if we do not align our orders, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. Let's work together to forecast demand accurately and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuations in demand and the potential for stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs, which could threaten all of our profits. I currently have 144 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $547.00. To maintain this trajectory, we need to carefully consider our order quantities and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuations in demand and the potential for stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be cautious about our production and ordering strategies to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. I currently have 108 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $1191.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be cautious about our production and ordering strategies to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. I currently have 108 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $1191.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure alignment and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 145 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 11, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [25]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 138 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 11, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 145 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to meet expected demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet expected demand while avoiding stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our inventory levels and recent demand trends to better forecast our needs and maintain a steady flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler's call for alignment in order quantities to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we maintain steady inventory levels and avoid stockouts, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our recent demand trends and align our orders to optimize our supply chain performance.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's calls for alignment in order quantities to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid stockouts, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that my current inventory is 139 units and I have no backlog. My total profit so far is $1259.00, and I am concerned about the risks of oversupply or stockouts affecting our collective profitability. Let's align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain performance and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize total profits and maintain a steady flow.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 175 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [26, 19, 25]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [55]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 145 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to meet expected demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet expected demand while avoiding stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our inventory levels and recent demand trends to better forecast our needs and maintain a steady flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler's call for alignment in order quantities to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we maintain steady inventory levels and avoid stockouts, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our recent demand trends and align our orders to optimize our supply chain performance.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's calls for alignment in order quantities to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid stockouts, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that my current inventory is 139 units and I have no backlog. My total profit so far is $1259.00, and I am concerned about the risks of oversupply or stockouts affecting our collective profitability. Let's align our orders based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain performance and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize total profits and maintain a steady flow.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 139 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [46, 39, 35]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 38
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 145 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to meet expected demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet expected demand while avoiding stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our inventory levels and recent demand trends to better forecast our needs and maintain a steady flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler's call for alignment in order quantities to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we maintain steady inventory levels and avoid stockouts, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our recent demand trends and align our orders to optimize our supply chain performance.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 157 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-291.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our coordination. If we do not align our orders and inventory levels, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet customer needs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders closely to recent demand trends to maintain stability in the supply chain. I currently have 199 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me in a strong position to support our downstream partners. However, I am concerned about the potential for stock-outs or oversupply if we do not communicate effectively. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's needs.

Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 157 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 14, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 157 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-291.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our coordination. If we do not align our orders and inventory levels, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet customer needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely to recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders closely to recent demand trends to maintain stability in the supply chain. I currently have 199 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me in a strong position to support our downstream partners. However, I am concerned about the potential for stock-outs or oversupply if we do not communicate effectively. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's needs. Let's work together to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production and orders closely to recent demand trends to maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent average demand while ensuring we do not create excess inventory that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 199 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [19, 25, 21]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [60]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 157 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-291.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our coordination. If we do not align our orders and inventory levels, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet customer needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely to recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders closely to recent demand trends to maintain stability in the supply chain. I currently have 199 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me in a strong position to support our downstream partners. However, I am concerned about the potential for stock-outs or oversupply if we do not communicate effectively. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's needs. Let's work together to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production and orders closely to recent demand trends to maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent average demand while ensuring we do not create excess inventory that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 156 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [39, 35, 35]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 157 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-291.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our coordination. If we do not align our orders and inventory levels, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet customer needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely to recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders closely to recent demand trends to maintain stability in the supply chain. I currently have 199 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me in a strong position to support our downstream partners. However, I am concerned about the potential for stock-outs or oversupply if we do not communicate effectively. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's needs. Let's work together to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of coordination to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production and orders closely to recent demand trends to maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent average demand while ensuring we do not create excess inventory that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-349.00, which is concerning. I currently have 171 units in inventory and no backlog. This gives me a buffer to meet demand, but I am aware that fluctuations could lead to stock-outs. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which would help stabilize our profits across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can keep our inventory levels stable and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Information Shared: I have 171 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently at $-349.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 166 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is at $205.50. I propose we collaborate on our demand forecasts to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which threatens our profits. We should also be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to increased holding and backlog costs, impacting our margins. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Information Shared: I have 166 units in inventory, no backlog, and my profit is currently at $205.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the need to align our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits. I currently have 215 units in inventory and no backlog, which gives me a buffer to meet demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $525.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which could lead to increased holding and backlog costs for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a stable supply while coordinating with others to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I have 215 units in inventory, no backlog, and my profit is currently at $525.00.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while preventing excess inventory. My current profit is $1395.50, and I have 171 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production plans to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which threatens our profits and could lead to stockouts or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning production with expected demand to maintain stability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 171 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [25]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 166 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-349.00, which is concerning. I currently have 171 units in inventory and no backlog. This gives me a buffer to meet demand, but I am aware that fluctuations could lead to stock-outs. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which would help stabilize our profits across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can keep our inventory levels stable and avoid unnecessary costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 166 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is at $205.50. I propose we collaborate on our demand forecasts to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which threatens our profits. We should also be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to increased holding and backlog costs, impacting our margins. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the need to align our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits. I currently have 215 units in inventory and no backlog, which gives me a buffer to meet demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $525.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which could lead to increased holding and backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while preventing excess inventory. My current profit is $1395.50, and I have 171 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production plans to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which threatens our profits and could lead to stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production schedules and demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which could lead to increased holding and backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while preventing excess inventory. My current profit is $1395.50, and I have 171 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production plans to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect, which threatens our profits and could lead to stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production schedules and demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 171 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [35, 35, 39]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($1395.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (171 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining stability in our supply chain. My current profit stands at $-421.00, which is concerning. I have 184 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet demand effectively. However, I am aware that fluctuations in demand could threaten my profit trajectory. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a bullwhip effect. We need to ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 184 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of collaboration to maintain stability in our supply chain. They are currently in a good position with 184 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet demand effectively. However, they also expressed concerns about demand fluctuations threatening their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we align our orders to reflect true market demand to maximize our total profits while preventing any potential market collapse.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of production is crucial to prevent any potential market collapse. I currently have 169 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand effectively. However, I am concerned about the fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit trajectory of $1493.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with the recent demand trends while ensuring we avoid excess stock that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent excess.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 184 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 173 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining stability in our supply chain. My current profit stands at $-421.00, which is concerning. I have 184 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet demand effectively. However, I am aware that fluctuations in demand could threaten my profit trajectory. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a bullwhip effect. We need to ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of collaboration to maintain stability in our supply chain. They are currently in a good position with 184 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet demand effectively. However, they also expressed concerns about demand fluctuations threatening their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we align our orders to reflect true market demand to maximize our total profits while preventing any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect true market demand to maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits while preventing any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of production is crucial to prevent any potential market collapse. I currently have 169 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand effectively. However, I am concerned about the fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit trajectory of $1493.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with the recent demand trends while ensuring we avoid excess stock that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to align our efforts and maximize total profits across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 227 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 25, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining stability in our supply chain. My current profit stands at $-421.00, which is concerning. I have 184 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet demand effectively. However, I am aware that fluctuations in demand could threaten my profit trajectory. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a bullwhip effect. We need to ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of collaboration to maintain stability in our supply chain. They are currently in a good position with 184 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet demand effectively. However, they also expressed concerns about demand fluctuations threatening their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we align our orders to reflect true market demand to maximize our total profits while preventing any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect true market demand to maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits while preventing any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of production is crucial to prevent any potential market collapse. I currently have 169 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand effectively. However, I am concerned about the fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit trajectory of $1493.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with the recent demand trends while ensuring we avoid excess stock that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to align our efforts and maximize total profits across the supply chain.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining stability in our supply chain. My current profit stands at $-421.00, which is concerning. I have 184 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet demand effectively. However, I am aware that fluctuations in demand could threaten my profit trajectory. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a bullwhip effect. We need to ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of collaboration to maintain stability in our supply chain. They are currently in a good position with 184 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet demand effectively. However, they also expressed concerns about demand fluctuations threatening their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we align our orders to reflect true market demand to maximize our total profits while preventing any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect true market demand to maintain stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits while preventing any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of production is crucial to prevent any potential market collapse. I currently have 169 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand effectively. However, I am concerned about the fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit trajectory of $1493.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with the recent demand trends while ensuring we avoid excess stock that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to align our efforts and maximize total profits across the supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 196 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-486.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid drastic fluctuations in inventory levels.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 196 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations in inventory levels. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while fulfilling current demand to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 199 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to avoid costs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment about aligning our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure steady demand fulfillment while avoiding excess inventory that could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our collective profitability. My current inventory is 264 units with no backlog, and my total profit so far is $457.00. We need to be cautious about our order quantities to avoid costs associated with holding excess inventory or incurring backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our collective profitability. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to ensure we do not overproduce and incur holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

          - Last order placed: 0
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round

          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 199 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 264 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [25, 28, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 196 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-486.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid drastic fluctuations in inventory levels.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations in inventory levels. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment about aligning our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure steady demand fulfillment while avoiding excess inventory that could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our collective profitability. My current inventory is 264 units with no backlog, and my total profit so far is $457.00. We need to be cautious about our order quantities to avoid costs associated with holding excess inventory or incurring backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasizing the need for coordination to stabilize our supply chain and prevent drastic fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our collective profitability. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to ensure we do not overproduce and incur holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 195 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [39, 48, 23]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 39
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 196 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-486.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid drastic fluctuations in inventory levels.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations in inventory levels. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment about aligning our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure steady demand fulfillment while avoiding excess inventory that could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our collective profitability. My current inventory is 264 units with no backlog, and my total profit so far is $457.00. We need to be cautious about our order quantities to avoid costs associated with holding excess inventory or incurring backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasizing the need for coordination to stabilize our supply chain and prevent drastic fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our collective profitability. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to ensure we do not overproduce and incur holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to match the expected demand of 20 units next round, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 215 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-571.50, indicating a need for careful order management to improve profitability.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which can destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all aim to order based on the expected demand of 20 units next round, ensuring we maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover the expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to order based on the recent demand trends and maintain a steady flow to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $85.50, which highlights the need for careful order management to sustain profitability.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to match the expected demand of 20 units next round, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all aim to order based on the recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to ensure we do not face stockouts or excessive inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders to match the expected demand of 20 units next round, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 288 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $435.50, which highlights the importance of careful order management to sustain profitability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 215 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 288 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 13, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [69]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  Proposal: Let's agree to order based on the recent demand trends and maintain a steady flow to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to match the expected demand of 20 units next round, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 213 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [48, 23, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to match the expected demand of 20 units next round, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to meet actual demand and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which can destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all aim to order based on the expected demand of 20 units next round, ensuring we maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to order based on the recent demand trends and maintain a steady flow to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to match the expected demand of 20 units next round, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all aim to order based on the recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to ensure we do not face stockouts or excessive inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders to match the expected demand of 20 units next round, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to match the expected demand of 20 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules closely to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which can destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while maintaining a healthy inventory level.
  Proposal: Let's agree to produce and order based on the expected demand of 20 units next round, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-655.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid drastic fluctuations in inventory levels.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 218 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet demand without risking stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations in inventory levels. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten my current profit of $55.00.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current inventory levels and recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 211 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders while maintaining a buffer for future demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations in inventory levels, which could threaten my current profit of $417.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on expected demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 218 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 211 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 202 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [23, 49, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-655.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid drastic fluctuations in inventory levels.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent drastic fluctuations in inventory levels.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 237 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-749.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet customer needs.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet demand while minimizing costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 237 units in inventory and no backlog, and I will be ordering 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and they plan to order 20 units this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 240 units and order 20 units from the Distributor to ensure I can meet the Retailer's needs while keeping my costs in check.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory and orders to minimize costs and maximize profits.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to meet the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 325 units and order 20 units from the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my costs in check.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my orders to maintain a stable supply while avoiding excessive inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor are both planning to order 20 units to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with these orders to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level to prevent holding costs from rising.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess stock.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 237 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 240 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 237 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-749.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet customer needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and they plan to order 20 units this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 240 units and order 20 units from the Distributor to ensure I can meet the Retailer's needs while keeping my costs in check.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to meet the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 325 units and order 20 units from the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my costs in check.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor are both planning to order 20 units to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with these orders to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level to prevent holding costs from rising.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and orders to prevent stock-outs or excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 325 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 30, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 24
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 237 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-749.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can meet customer needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and they plan to order 20 units this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 240 units and order 20 units from the Distributor to ensure I can meet the Retailer's needs while keeping my costs in check.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor are both planning to order 20 units to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with these orders to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level to prevent holding costs from rising.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and orders to prevent stock-outs or excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 261 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders based on the recent demand trends to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $-864.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 274 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-112.00, which is concerning. We need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively while ensuring I can fulfill current demand and maintain a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10, 10, and 6 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
  Information Shared: I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0. This means I need to be cautious with my order decisions to avoid stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider the recent demand of 30, 20, and 16 units as a guideline for our orders, while being mindful of our current inventory levels to ensure we do not overcommit resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively while ensuring I can fulfill current demand and maintain a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and my current inventory of 359 units, ensuring we all meet customer needs without risking stock-outs or excessive inventory.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $240.50, and I have 359 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 261 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 274 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 261 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on the recent demand trends to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 274 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-112.00, which is concerning. We need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10, 10, and 6 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider the recent demand of 30, 20, and 16 units as a guideline for our orders, while being mindful of our current inventory levels to ensure we do not overcommit resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and my current inventory of 359 units, ensuring we all meet customer needs without risking stock-outs or excessive inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory of 271 units and ensuring I do not overproduce, as my current profit is $1677.00 and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and ordering strategies based on the recent demand trends of 50, 30, and 36 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 359 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 20, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [56]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 261 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on the recent demand trends to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 274 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-112.00, which is concerning. We need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10, 10, and 6 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider the recent demand of 30, 20, and 16 units as a guideline for our orders, while being mindful of our current inventory levels to ensure we do not overcommit resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and my current inventory of 359 units, ensuring we all meet customer needs without risking stock-outs or excessive inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory of 271 units and ensuring I do not overproduce, as my current profit is $1677.00 and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and ordering strategies based on the recent demand trends of 50, 30, and 36 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 271 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [50, 30, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 261 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on the recent demand trends to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 274 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-112.00, which is concerning. We need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the recent demand of 10, 10, and 6 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider the recent demand of 30, 20, and 16 units as a guideline for our orders, while being mindful of our current inventory levels to ensure we do not overcommit resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and my current inventory of 359 units, ensuring we all meet customer needs without risking stock-outs or excessive inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory of 271 units and ensuring I do not overproduce, as my current profit is $1677.00 and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and ordering strategies based on the recent demand trends of 50, 30, and 36 units to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 272 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 6, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 364 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 16, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [69]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 272 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-978.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our order quantities accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to optimize our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our order quantities accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 282 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 36, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 272 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-978.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our order quantities accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to optimize our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our order quantities accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-1110.00, which is concerning. I currently have 284 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 284 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet demand for now.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply and proposed that we share our expected demand for the next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent fluctuations that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 297 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-290.50. I believe we should align our orders based on expected demand to maximize our collective profits and avoid risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current inventory and expected demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to optimize our supply chain.

I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to prevent fluctuations that could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 391 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $58.00. I propose we all communicate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits and lead to market instability.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 284, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 4, Profit: 10.00, Total Profit: -1110.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.9, rationale=With sufficient inventory and recent demand trends, I can safely order to meet expected demand while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, but current inventory levels provide a cushion against stock-outs., expected_demand_next_round=10, llm_inventory=284, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[6, 9, 4], llm_incoming=[14], llm_last_order=10
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 284 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 9, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 297 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 9, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 50 units in inventory and no backlog, I can fulfill current demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts. I will order to cover potential demand fluctuations.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-1110.00, which is concerning. I currently have 284 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply and proposed that we share our expected demand for the next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent fluctuations that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 297 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-290.50. I believe we should align our orders based on expected demand to maximize our collective profits and avoid risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to optimize our supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply and proposed that we share our expected demand for the next round. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to prevent fluctuations that could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 391 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $58.00. I propose we all communicate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits and lead to market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to optimize our supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply and proposed that we share our expected demand for the next round. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the need for coordination to prevent fluctuations that could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to optimize our supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 305 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 49, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 38
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-1110.00, which is concerning. I currently have 284 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply and proposed that we share our expected demand for the next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent fluctuations that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 297 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-290.50. I believe we should align our orders based on expected demand to maximize our collective profits and avoid risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to optimize our supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply and proposed that we share our expected demand for the next round. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to prevent fluctuations that could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 391 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $58.00. I propose we all communicate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits and lead to market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to optimize our supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply and proposed that we share our expected demand for the next round. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the need for coordination to prevent fluctuations that could destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to optimize our supply chain.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1251.50, which is a significant concern. I have 308 units in inventory and no backlog, but we must coordinate to ensure that we can meet demand without causing instability in the supply chain. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk a bullwhip effect that could lead to stock-outs or excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 308 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit so far is $-1251.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-418.50, and I have 331 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and ensure we can meet demand without causing instability in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. I currently have 425 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-67.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we can meet demand without causing instability, while also being mindful of our holding and backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 308 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 4, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 331 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 4, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1251.50, which is a significant concern. I have 308 units in inventory and no backlog, but we must coordinate to ensure that we can meet demand without causing instability in the supply chain. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk a bullwhip effect that could lead to stock-outs or excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-418.50, and I have 331 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and ensure we can meet demand without causing instability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. I currently have 425 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-67.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we can meet demand without causing instability, while also being mindful of our holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 337 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting that I have the capacity to produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock. I propose we align our forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt everyone's bottom line.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align our efforts and maintain a steady flow of products.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 425 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 14, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [55]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1251.50, which is a significant concern. I have 308 units in inventory and no backlog, but we must coordinate to ensure that we can meet demand without causing instability in the supply chain. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk a bullwhip effect that could lead to stock-outs or excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-418.50, and I have 331 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and ensure we can meet demand without causing instability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. I currently have 425 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-67.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we can meet demand without causing instability, while also being mindful of our holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 337 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting that I have the capacity to produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock. I propose we align our forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt everyone's bottom line.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align our efforts and maintain a steady flow of products.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-418.50, and I have 331 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and ensure we can meet demand without causing instability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. I currently have 425 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-67.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we can meet demand without causing instability, while also being mindful of our holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 337 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting that I have the capacity to produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock. I propose we align our forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt everyone's bottom line.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align our efforts and maintain a steady flow of products.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-1388.50, and I have 314 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could lead to stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 314 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 5, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 332 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 5, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 437 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 15, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [57]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-1388.50, and I have 314 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could lead to stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. My current profit is $-193.00, and I have 437 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our supply chain and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts or oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 347 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 35, 37]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 35
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-1388.50, and I have 314 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could lead to stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. My current profit is $-193.00, and I have 437 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our supply chain and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts or oversupply.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 320 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 469 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 28, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 374 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [35, 37, 23]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 35
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 320 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-1526.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

Shipments received per agent: [28, 37, 57, 72]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory status and profit trajectory to encourage collaboration.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly.
  Information Shared: I currently have 336 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-1664.00. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 369 units and a profit of $-787.50, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain to prevent collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 369 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand while planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 498 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-549.00. To optimize our supply chain, we should align our orders based on expected demand and maintain a buffer to prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us avoid potential market collapse and ensure steady profits for all of us.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 398 units and no backlog, I can support our collective goal of preventing stock-outs while also maximizing my profit of $1458.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies based on the recent demand trends to ensure we meet the expected demand without creating excess inventory or risking stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 336 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 369 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory status and profit trajectory to encourage collaboration.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 369 units and a profit of $-787.50, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain to prevent collapse.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 498 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-549.00. To optimize our supply chain, we should align our orders based on expected demand and maintain a buffer to prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us avoid potential market collapse and ensure steady profits for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on expected demand to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 398 units and no backlog, I can support our collective goal of preventing stock-outs while also maximizing my profit of $1458.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies based on the recent demand trends to ensure we meet the expected demand without creating excess inventory or risking stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand of 37, 23, and 28 units to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 398 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [37, 23, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory status and profit trajectory to encourage collaboration.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 369 units and a profit of $-787.50, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain to prevent collapse.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 498 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-549.00. To optimize our supply chain, we should align our orders based on expected demand and maintain a buffer to prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us avoid potential market collapse and ensure steady profits for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on expected demand to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 398 units and no backlog, I can support our collective goal of preventing stock-outs while also maximizing my profit of $1458.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies based on the recent demand trends to ensure we meet the expected demand without creating excess inventory or risking stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand of 37, 23, and 28 units to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($1458.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (398 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is $-1797.50, which is concerning. I currently have 337 units in inventory and no backlog. This puts me in a good position to meet demand, but I am aware that fluctuations could lead to stock-outs. We need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. If we don't manage our inventory levels carefully, we risk a bullwhip effect that could destabilize the entire supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
  Information Shared: I have 337 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit trajectory is currently negative, which affects all of us.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 368 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-911.50, which is concerning. We must work together to optimize our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our profits further.

I also note the Wholesaler's concern about optimizing orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities closely to maintain a stable supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly, as I currently have 505 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-711.50, which is concerning.

Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock, as I currently have 395 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit is $1400.50, and I want to ensure that we all maximize our profits together. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our profits further.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 337 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 12, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 368 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 12, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is $-1797.50, which is concerning. I currently have 337 units in inventory and no backlog. This puts me in a good position to meet demand, but I am aware that fluctuations could lead to stock-outs. We need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. If we don't manage our inventory levels carefully, we risk a bullwhip effect that could destabilize the entire supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 368 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-911.50, which is concerning. We must work together to optimize our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our profits further.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about optimizing orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities closely to maintain a stable supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly, as I currently have 505 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-711.50, which is concerning. We must work together to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules closely to prevent stockouts and maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock, as I currently have 395 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit is $1400.50, and I want to ensure that we all maximize our profits together. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our profits further. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our production and order quantities.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 505 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 20, 24]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [56]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is $-1797.50, which is concerning. I currently have 337 units in inventory and no backlog. This puts me in a good position to meet demand, but I am aware that fluctuations could lead to stock-outs. We need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. If we don't manage our inventory levels carefully, we risk a bullwhip effect that could destabilize the entire supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 368 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-911.50, which is concerning. We must work together to optimize our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our profits further.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about optimizing orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities closely to maintain a stable supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly, as I currently have 505 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-711.50, which is concerning. We must work together to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and ensure steady demand fulfillment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules closely to prevent stockouts and maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock, as I currently have 395 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit is $1400.50, and I want to ensure that we all maximize our profits together. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our profits further. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our production and order quantities.

My total profit is $1400.50, and I want to ensure that we all maximize our profits together. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our profits further. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our production and order quantities.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 345 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 14, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 372 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 14, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 345 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1940.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is at $-880.00, and I have 517 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but we must be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our production levels match the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the anticipated demand of 36 units for the next round, considering my current inventory of 395 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 517 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 24, 24]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [56]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 345 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1940.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is at $-880.00, and I have 517 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but we must be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our production levels match the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the anticipated demand of 36 units for the next round, considering my current inventory of 395 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 395 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 36, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 345 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1940.00. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is at $-880.00, and I have 517 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but we must be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our production levels match the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce to meet the anticipated demand of 36 units for the next round, considering my current inventory of 395 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 356 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 356 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2085.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 532 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [24, 24, 27]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [65]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 24
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 356 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2085.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent market instability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and ensure we are all on the same page.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on recent demand trends to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-1043.50, and I have 532 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to buffer against fluctuations, but we must be cautious of over-ordering. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and ensure we are all on the same page to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on recent demand trends to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order strategies carefully to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent market instability. My current profit is $1308.50, and I have 394 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and ensure we are all on the same page to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 394 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 36, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 356 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2085.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 366 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2233.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. Based on my current inventory, I can meet the expected demand, but we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we don't manage our inventory levels carefully, we risk a bullwhip effect that could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and suggest we all share our inventory levels and order quantities to maintain a steady flow and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our inventory and order plans to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 366 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $-2233.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 390 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit so far is $-1288.00. This situation is concerning, and if we do not coordinate our strategies, we risk destabilizing the entire supply chain. I propose that we all share our upcoming order quantities to ensure we are not over or under ordering, which could lead to increased holding or backlog costs for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our order quantities to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 548 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit so far is $-1217.50. To maximize our collective profits, we need to ensure our orders reflect recent demand trends while avoiding excessive inventory or stock-outs. Let's work together to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 366 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 390 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 366 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2233.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. Based on my current inventory, I can meet the expected demand, but we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we don't manage our inventory levels carefully, we risk a bullwhip effect that could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and suggest we all share our inventory levels and order quantities to maintain a steady flow and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our inventory and order plans to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 390 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit so far is $-1288.00. This situation is concerning, and if we do not coordinate our strategies, we risk destabilizing the entire supply chain. I propose that we all share our upcoming order quantities to ensure we are not over or under ordering, which could lead to increased holding or backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our order quantities to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 548 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit so far is $-1217.50. To maximize our collective profits, we need to ensure our orders reflect recent demand trends while avoiding excessive inventory or stock-outs. Let's work together to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share our upcoming order quantities to ensure we are not over or under ordering, which could lead to increased holding or backlog costs for all of us.
- Factory: I hear Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and order quantities to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to avoid excess stock and holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our upcoming order quantities and production plans to ensure we are aligned and can maximize our profits collectively.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our order quantities to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 548 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit so far is $-1217.50. To maximize our collective profits, we need to ensure our orders reflect recent demand trends while avoiding excessive inventory or stock-outs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 401 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 41, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($1270.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (401 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
