--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that communication is key to managing supply chain efficiency. I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with a spike to 11 units in the last round, which could indicate a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be vigilant about our inventory levels and coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts throughout the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 30 units to maintain a buffer stock and align with anticipated demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: Anticipating demand increases while maintaining a safety stock is crucial.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our order quantities and minimize stockouts.
  Information Shared: As of now, I have 99 units in inventory and no backlog, but I foresee an expected demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they foresee an expected demand of 30 units next round and will be ordering 30 units to maintain a buffer stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should remain vigilant about our inventory levels to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand while ensuring I have enough stock to fulfill any potential increases in orders from both the Retailer and Distributor.
  Strategy Hint: Anticipate demand while maintaining sufficient inventory to mitigate stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and am anticipating an expected demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they foresee an expected demand of 30 units next round and will be ordering 30 units to maintain a buffer stock. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our ordering to meet the expected demand while minimizing the risk of excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain sufficient inventory to meet the projected demand without overstocking.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with anticipated demand while keeping enough safety stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and an expected demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they foresee an expected demand of 30 units next round, and Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a consensus on increasing order quantities to meet demand. However, I note that I currently have 99 units in inventory and have observed a spike in demand to 11 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a balance between meeting the expected demand and avoiding overstock.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain awareness of demand trends while avoiding excessive inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory, no backlog, and I expect a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear Wholesaler said they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand, and Distributor mentioned they will also order 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a strong consensus on the expected demand increase across the supply chain. However, I want to highlight that my expected demand is 30 units, and I currently have 99 units in inventory, which puts me in a good position to handle the upcoming demand without risking overstock. Therefore, I will proceed with my planned order of 30 units to maintain my buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning orders with realistic demand forecasts while managing inventory levels is crucial.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular cadence for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and an expected demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 30 units to maintain their buffer while avoiding excess inventory. Distributor has also mentioned ordering 50 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a strong consensus around increasing order quantities, but we need to ensure we are not overcommitting to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units to align with the expected demand and ensure I have enough inventory to meet any fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain sufficient inventory while being mindful of order quantities to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on our shared demand forecasts to ensure we all have adequate inventory without overstocking.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and an expected demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 30 units, maintaining their buffer while avoiding excess inventory. Wholesaler has also maintained their order of 50 units to ensure sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a general consensus on increasing order quantities to meet expected demand. However, I want to emphasize that my expected demand for the next round is 50 units, and I currently have 99 units in inventory, which positions me well to accommodate this demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will also place an order of 50 units to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory levels optimal.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning our orders with realistic demand expectations while maintaining appropriate inventory levels is key.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and an expected demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 30 units, maintaining their buffer while avoiding excess inventory. Distributor and Wholesaler have both highlighted a consensus on increasing order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning on higher demand expectations. However, I want to reiterate that my current inventory is 99 units, which allows me to meet the expected demand without risking overstock. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to balance my inventory levels while supporting the overall demand.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on balancing orders with current inventory levels to avoid overstock while meeting demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders effectively and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 99, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.7, rationale=Ordering to cover expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=Potential spikes in demand could lead to increased backlog costs if not managed., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=99, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they foresee an expected demand of 30 units next round and will be ordering 30 units to maintain a buffer stock. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our ordering to meet the expected demand while minimizing the risk of excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain sufficient inventory to meet the projected demand without overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they foresee an expected demand of 30 units next round, and Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a consensus on increasing order quantities to meet demand. However, I note that I currently have 99 units in inventory and have observed a spike in demand to 11 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a balance between meeting the expected demand and avoiding overstock.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler said they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand, and Distributor mentioned they will also order 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a strong consensus on the expected demand increase across the supply chain. However, I want to highlight that my expected demand is 30 units, and I currently have 99 units in inventory, which puts me in a good position to handle the upcoming demand without risking overstock. Therefore, I will proceed with my planned order of 30 units to maintain my buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular cadence for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 30 units to maintain their buffer while avoiding excess inventory. Distributor has also mentioned ordering 50 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a strong consensus around increasing order quantities, but we need to ensure we are not overcommitting to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units to align with the expected demand and ensure I have enough inventory to meet any fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on our shared demand forecasts to ensure we all have adequate inventory without overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 30 units, maintaining their buffer while avoiding excess inventory. Wholesaler has also maintained their order of 50 units to ensure sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a general consensus on increasing order quantities to meet expected demand. However, I want to emphasize that my expected demand for the next round is 50 units, and I currently have 99 units in inventory, which positions me well to accommodate this demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will also place an order of 50 units to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory levels optimal.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 30 units, maintaining their buffer while avoiding excess inventory. Distributor and Wholesaler have both highlighted a consensus on increasing order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning on higher demand expectations. However, I want to reiterate that my current inventory is 99 units, which allows me to meet the expected demand without risking overstock. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to balance my inventory levels while supporting the overall demand.
  Proposal: Let's continue to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders effectively and minimize the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they foresee an expected demand of 30 units next round and will be ordering 30 units to maintain a buffer stock. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our ordering to meet the expected demand while minimizing the risk of excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain sufficient inventory to meet the projected demand without overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they foresee an expected demand of 30 units next round, and Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a consensus on increasing order quantities to meet demand. However, I note that I currently have 99 units in inventory and have observed a spike in demand to 11 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a balance between meeting the expected demand and avoiding overstock.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler said they will place an order of 50 units to align with anticipated demand, and Distributor mentioned they will also order 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a strong consensus on the expected demand increase across the supply chain. However, I want to highlight that my expected demand is 30 units, and I currently have 99 units in inventory, which puts me in a good position to handle the upcoming demand without risking overstock. Therefore, I will proceed with my planned order of 30 units to maintain my buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular cadence for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 30 units to maintain their buffer while avoiding excess inventory. Distributor has also mentioned ordering 50 units to align with anticipated demand.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 30 units, maintaining their buffer while avoiding excess inventory. Distributor and Wholesaler have both highlighted a consensus on increasing order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning on higher demand expectations. However, I want to reiterate that my current inventory is 99 units, which allows me to meet the expected demand without risking overstock. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to balance my inventory levels while supporting the overall demand.
  Proposal: Let's continue to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders effectively and minimize the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 20 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 39]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [139]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 89]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [11, 11, 11, 30]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand patterns showing a slight decline with orders of 11, 9, and 7 units. I believe this could indicate a stabilization in customer demand. Collaboration is essential to mitigate the bullwhip effect. I hear that we need to align our order quantities based on this trend to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider adjusting our orders to reflect more accurate demand forecasts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units while monitoring future demand closely.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on balancing inventory levels with anticipated demand to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to enhance our order accuracy and reduce variability.
  Information Shared: Currently, I hold 104 units in inventory and have a backlog of 0 units, indicating I can fulfill upcoming orders without delay.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a slight decline in demand with recent orders of 11, 9, and 7 units, indicating a potential stabilization in customer demand. This suggests we should align our order quantities more closely with these trends to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to adjust our orders to better reflect anticipated demand. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 50 units next round to maintain an adequate inventory while mitigating the risk of backlog.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on adjusting order quantities based on observed demand trends to minimize excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help all of us optimize our orders and reduce variability.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 44 units in inventory with no backlog, and I plan to order 50 units based on projected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a stabilization in customer demand and will maintain their order at 30 units while monitoring future demand closely. I also noted the Wholesaler's intention to place an order of 50 units based on similar observations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders with the recent demand trends to avoid excess backlog and optimize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units next round to address my current backlog of 36 units while anticipating the expected demand of 50 units.
  Strategy Hint: Align order quantities with observed demand trends to minimize backlog and excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, indicating a need for immediate restocking.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a slight decline in demand and will maintain their order quantity at 30 units. I also note the Wholesaler's intent to adjust their order to 50 units based on similar observations. Additionally, the Distributor has highlighted their need for immediate restocking due to a backlog of 36 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the recent demand patterns suggest a stabilization, we need to be cautious to avoid excess inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units next round to align with anticipated demand while maintaining a lean inventory. This allows me to avoid holding costs and respond effectively to potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning order quantities with observed demand trends while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to enhance visibility and minimize variability.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory, and I will be ordering 20 units to align with expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to adjust orders based on demand trends, and the Distributor highlighted their backlog of 36 units, indicating an immediate need for restocking. I also acknowledge the Factory's cautious approach with their order of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all recognize the stabilization of demand, we must coordinate our orders to prevent excess inventory and ensure timely fulfillment. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 30 units, but I suggest we all consider slightly increasing our orders to account for potential fluctuations in demand while avoiding stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: Prioritize coordination and communication to align orders with observed demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve coordination and reduce variability across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders without delay.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should slightly increase our orders to account for potential fluctuations in demand, and the Distributor highlighted their backlog, indicating a need for immediate restocking. The Factory's cautious approach with a 20-unit order suggests they are also aware of the need to balance inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize a stabilization in demand but must coordinate to prevent excess inventory and ensure timely fulfillment across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units next round while continuing to monitor demand closely.
  Strategy Hint: Align order quantities with observed demand trends while preparing for potential fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, enabling us to optimize our orders and reduce variability effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 44 units in inventory with no backlog and plan to order 50 units based on projected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should slightly increase our orders to account for potential fluctuations in demand while maintaining their order at 30 units. The Wholesaler mentioned their plan to maintain an order of 50 units next round, and the Factory emphasized a cautious approach with a 20-unit order. Given my current backlog of 36 units and the recent demand patterns, I believe we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to meet anticipated demand without creating excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better match observed demand trends and avoid backlog issues. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units next round to address my backlog and align with expected demand.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 36 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 39, 37]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [71]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (36 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they observed a stabilization in customer demand and will maintain their order at 30 units while monitoring future demand closely. I also noted the Wholesaler's intention to place an order of 50 units based on similar observations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders with the recent demand trends to avoid excess backlog and optimize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units next round to address my current backlog of 36 units while anticipating the expected demand of 50 units.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

I also note the Wholesaler's intent to adjust their order to 50 units based on similar observations. Additionally, the Distributor has highlighted their need for immediate restocking due to a backlog of 36 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the recent demand patterns suggest a stabilization, we need to be cautious to avoid excess inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units next round to align with anticipated demand while maintaining a lean inventory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 89, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they observed a stabilization in customer demand and will maintain their order at 30 units while monitoring future demand closely. I also noted the Wholesaler's intention to place an order of 50 units based on similar observations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders with the recent demand trends to avoid excess backlog and optimize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units next round to address my current backlog of 36 units while anticipating the expected demand of 50 units.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they observed a slight decline in demand and will maintain their order quantity at 30 units. I also note the Wholesaler's intent to adjust their order to 50 units based on similar observations.

          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 30 units to ensure we can meet expected demand while managing our inventory levels effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer stock to avoid stockouts and reduce holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we coordinate our order placements based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect in our supply chain.
  Information Shared: My recent order figures show demand fluctuating between 7 and 11 units, suggesting a moderate increase may be on the horizon.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends and the need to maintain buffer stock to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for possible spikes in demand and manage our orders accordingly. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to align with the projected increase while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet demand.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning order quantities with projected demand trends while maintaining adequate inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to coordinate order placements and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Recent demand has fluctuated between 7 and 11 units, indicating a moderate increase may be imminent. My current inventory is 92 units, which is sufficient for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should prepare for possible spikes in demand and maintain a buffer stock. Additionally, the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, indicating a readiness for increased orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order placements to effectively manage the anticipated demand fluctuations while minimizing excess inventory costs. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to complement my current inventory of 32 units and meet the expected demand of 50 units.
  Strategy Hint: Align order quantities with expected demand while managing inventory effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order placements based on shared demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should prepare for possible spikes in demand, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment regarding maintaining buffer stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is a consensus on the potential for increased demand, my recent orders show a significant fluctuation with a higher recent demand of 107 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to manage my inventory carefully while preparing for future demand spikes.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on cautious order placements to manage inventory effectively while being aware of demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our recent demand figures more frequently to better align our order quantities and minimize volatility in our supply chain.
  Information Shared: My recent demand has shown significant fluctuations with a peak demand of 107 units, and I currently have 0 units in inventory.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned placing an order of 50 units based on projected demand increases, and the Distributor echoed this with a similar order. Additionally, the Factory shared information about significant demand fluctuations with a recent peak of 107 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the potential for increased demand, which suggests that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet this demand without overextending our inventories. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units this round to balance my inventory levels while being prepared for potential spikes in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focused on maintaining a balance between inventory levels and anticipated demand to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we align our order quantities and share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize excess and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My recent demand figures have fluctuated between 7 and 11 units, indicating a moderate increase in demand. My current inventory is 132 units, which allows for some flexibility in response to demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to manage potential spikes in demand, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment. Additionally, the Factory mentioned significant demand fluctuations with a peak of 107 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for a careful approach to ordering to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for increased demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to align with projected demand while ensuring I have sufficient inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning our order quantities with projected demand trends while maintaining adequate inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we continue sharing our demand forecasts regularly to optimize our order placements and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My recent demand observations have shown fluctuations between 9 and 11 units, and I currently have 92 units in inventory, which is sufficient for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to manage potential spikes in demand, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning with projected demand. Additionally, the Factory emphasized the need for careful ordering due to significant demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of preparing for increased demand while balancing our inventories. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning order quantities with expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts in more detail to better align our orders and minimize fluctuations across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 39 and 41 units, indicating a potential increase. My current inventory is 32 units, which necessitates careful planning.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining a balance in inventory levels while being prepared for potential spikes in demand. Additionally, the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this call for careful ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adapting to demand fluctuations. However, I also noted that my recent demand has shown significant peaks, reaching as high as 107 units, which indicates a potential mismatch if we all order similarly. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units this round to carefully manage my inventory while remaining vigilant about demand spikes.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on cautious order placements to manage inventory effectively while being aware of demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our recent demand figures more frequently to better align our order quantities and minimize volatility in our supply chain.
  Information Shared: My recent demand has shown significant fluctuations, with a peak of 107 units, and I currently have 0 units in inventory.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 132, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: -27.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=Ordering to cover expected demand while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand spikes could lead to stockouts if underestimated., expected_demand_next_round=27, llm_inventory=132, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 7, 11], llm_incoming=[41], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 132 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should prepare for possible spikes in demand and maintain a buffer stock. Additionally, the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, indicating a readiness for increased orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order placements to effectively manage the anticipated demand fluctuations while minimizing excess inventory costs. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to complement my current inventory of 32 units and meet the expected demand of 50 units.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order placements based on shared demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should prepare for possible spikes in demand, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment regarding maintaining buffer stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is a consensus on the potential for increased demand, my recent orders show a significant fluctuation with a higher recent demand of 107 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to manage my inventory carefully while preparing for future demand spikes.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our recent demand figures more frequently to better align our order quantities and minimize volatility in our supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned placing an order of 50 units based on projected demand increases, and the Distributor echoed this with a similar order. Additionally, the Factory shared information about significant demand fluctuations with a recent peak of 107 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the potential for increased demand, which suggests that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet this demand without overextending our inventories. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units this round to balance my inventory levels while being prepared for potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we align our order quantities and share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize excess and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to manage potential spikes in demand, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment. Additionally, the Factory mentioned significant demand fluctuations with a peak of 107 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for a careful approach to ordering to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for increased demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to align with projected demand while ensuring I have sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we continue sharing our demand forecasts regularly to optimize our order placements and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to manage potential spikes in demand, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning with projected demand. Additionally, the Factory emphasized the need for careful ordering due to significant demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of preparing for increased demand while balancing our inventories. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts in more detail to better align our orders and minimize fluctuations across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining a balance in inventory levels while being prepared for potential spikes in demand. Additionally, the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this call for careful ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adapting to demand fluctuations. However, I also noted that my recent demand has shown significant peaks, reaching as high as 107 units, which indicates a potential mismatch if we all order similarly. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units this round to carefully manage my inventory while remaining vigilant about demand spikes.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [89, 31, 107]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should prepare for possible spikes in demand and maintain a buffer stock. Additionally, the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, indicating a readiness for increased orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order placements to effectively manage the anticipated demand fluctuations while minimizing excess inventory costs. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to complement my current inventory of 32 units and meet the expected demand of 50 units.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order placements based on shared demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should prepare for possible spikes in demand, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment regarding maintaining buffer stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is a consensus on the potential for increased demand, my recent orders show a significant fluctuation with a higher recent demand of 107 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to manage my inventory carefully while preparing for future demand spikes.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our recent demand figures more frequently to better align our order quantities and minimize volatility in our supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned placing an order of 50 units based on projected demand increases, and the Distributor echoed this with a similar order. Additionally, the Factory shared information about significant demand fluctuations with a recent peak of 107 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the potential for increased demand, which suggests that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet this demand without overextending our inventories. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units this round to balance my inventory levels while being prepared for potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we align our order quantities and share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize excess and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to manage potential spikes in demand, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment. Additionally, the Factory mentioned significant demand fluctuations with a peak of 107 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for a careful approach to ordering to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for increased demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to align with projected demand while ensuring I have sufficient inventory.

Additionally, the Factory emphasized the need for careful ordering due to significant demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of preparing for increased demand while balancing our inventories. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts in more detail to better align our orders and minimize fluctuations across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining a balance in inventory levels while being prepared for potential spikes in demand. Additionally, the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this call for careful ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of adapting to demand fluctuations. However, I also noted that my recent demand has shown significant peaks, reaching as high as 107 units, which indicates a potential mismatch if we all order similarly. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units this round to carefully manage my inventory while remaining vigilant about demand spikes.
  Proposal: I propose we share our recent demand figures more frequently to better align our order quantities and minimize volatility in our supply chain.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 157, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 12, Profit: 60.00, Total Profit: -46.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=To ensure sufficient inventory for expected demand while avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could lead to higher backlog costs if unanticipated., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=157, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[7, 11, 12], llm_incoming=[42], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 157 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 107, 92]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=Anticipating steady demand based on recent orders while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could increase backlog costs if not managed, but current inventory level is healthy., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=189, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 12, 9], llm_incoming=[39], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 189 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that demand has been fluctuating with orders of 11, 12, and 9 units, and emphasized the importance of monitoring inventory to prevent stockouts. Additionally, the Wholesaler mentioned the need to maintain inventory levels based on projected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all observing similar trends in demand variability and the need for coordination. Therefore, I will maintain my buffer inventory of 115 units and order 50 units to align with anticipated demand, while also suggesting that we share our inventory levels and order forecasts to better navigate these fluctuations together.
  Proposal: Let's agree to regularly share our inventory levels and order forecasts to improve our collective response to demand changes.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that demand has been fluctuating recently and recommended close monitoring of inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of maintaining inventory while ordering based on projected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the potential for demand variability and the need for strategic coordination. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping a close watch on inventory levels to adapt to any further fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our order quantities and current inventory levels regularly to enhance our collective responsiveness to demand changes.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned that we should remain vigilant about our inventory levels to adapt effectively to demand fluctuations. The Distributor also highlighted the importance of maintaining buffer inventory while responding to expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for strategic coordination. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and place an order of 30 units to align with my expectations for the next round, while also suggesting that we share our order quantities and forecasts to enhance our responsiveness to demand changes.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [107, 92, 89]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 62
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 225 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should be cautious with our upcoming orders due to declining demand patterns and that they will maintain their current order strategy of 30 units. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the need to align orders with demand trends and will maintain their order of 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be vigilant about our order quantities to prevent overstocking while ensuring we meet the expected demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to balance my inventory and align with the cautious approach both Retailer and Wholesaler are taking.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better anticipate fluctuations and optimize our inventory decisions collectively.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 171 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [42, 39, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [136]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [92, 89, 86]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 100
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should be cautious with our upcoming orders due to declining demand patterns and that they will maintain their current order strategy of 30 units. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the need to align orders with demand trends and will maintain their order of 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be vigilant about our order quantities to prevent overstocking while ensuring we meet the expected demand.

External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [39, 89, 139, 100]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with recent orders being 9, 6, and 10 units. This suggests a potential trend in increasing demand. I encourage everyone to consider adjusting their order quantities accordingly to avoid stockouts. My current inventory is 254 units with no backlog, so I am well-positioned to meet this demand. However, I believe we should coordinate to share demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect across our supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 30 units for the next round to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining a buffer stock while anticipating demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to align our order strategies and reduce excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 254 units in inventory and no backlog, anticipating a demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that there are fluctuations in recent demand patterns and suggested maintaining order quantities to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider increasing our order quantities to meet potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units next round to align with this observed trend while ensuring I maintain adequate inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Adjusting order quantities based on observed demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly demand forecasting meeting to align our order strategies and minimize inventory excess.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 254 units in inventory and no backlog, anticipating a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that recent demand patterns show fluctuations and suggested we adjust our order quantities to avoid stockouts. I also hear Wholesaler agreeing with this observation and proposing to increase order quantities to meet potential spikes in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to better match supply with the expected demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units for the next round to align with this cautious approach while ensuring I have sufficient inventory to meet demand.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining a balance between sufficient inventory and cost management.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize excess inventory and prevent stockouts.
  Information Shared: My current inventory stands at 240 units with no backlog, and I expect a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer mentioned that there are fluctuations in demand patterns and proposed we adjust our order quantities to avoid stockouts. I also hear Wholesaler agreeing with this observation and suggesting an increase in order quantities to meet potential spikes in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is potential for increased demand, my current inventory situation is critical as I have none at the moment. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units next round to align with the cautious approach while attempting to minimize my backlog risk. I suggest we maintain open communication about our inventory levels and demand forecasts to optimize our strategies collectively.
  Strategy Hint: Prioritize minimizing backlog while cautiously managing order quantities.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts weekly to better align our order strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, anticipating a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear Wholesaler mentioned that we should consider increasing our order quantities to meet potential spikes in demand, and Distributor echoed the need for caution in matching supply with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while I agree with the importance of aligning our orders to avoid stockouts, we must also be mindful of overstocking given the recent fluctuations in demand. I suggest we continue to share our demand forecasts to better align our strategies. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units for the next round to keep sufficient inventory while avoiding excess.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining a buffer stock while managing order quantities to match demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular demand forecasting meeting to align our order strategies and minimize excess inventory across our supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 254 units in inventory and no backlog, anticipating a demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7

Distributor echoed the need for caution and decided to maintain their order quantity at 50 units, while Factory expressed the urgency of minimizing backlog and will order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all recognize the importance of balancing inventory and demand, we should coordinate closely to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units for the next round to align with the observed trends and ensure we collectively address potential spikes in demand.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning order quantities based on observed demand trends while managing inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular demand forecasting meeting to share insights and adjust our strategies accordingly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 254 units in inventory with no backlog, anticipating a demand of 50 units next round.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 254, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -255.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=To cover expected demand and maintain a buffer to prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=High potential for demand fluctuations leading to stockouts if orders are too low., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=254, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 6, 10], llm_incoming=[40], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 254 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 6, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler mentioned that we should consider increasing our order quantities to meet potential spikes in demand, and Distributor echoed the need for caution in matching supply with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while I agree with the importance of aligning our orders to avoid stockouts, we must also be mindful of overstocking given the recent fluctuations in demand. I suggest we continue to share our demand forecasts to better align our strategies. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units for the next round to keep sufficient inventory while avoiding excess.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular demand forecasting meeting to align our order strategies and minimize excess inventory across our supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer mentioned maintaining order quantities to avoid stockouts while being cautious of overstocking due to demand fluctuations. Distributor echoed the need for caution and decided to maintain their order quantity at 50 units, while Factory expressed the urgency of minimizing backlog and will order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all recognize the importance of balancing inventory and demand, we should coordinate closely to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units for the next round to align with the observed trends and ensure we collectively address potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular demand forecasting meeting to share insights and adjust our strategies accordingly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining order quantities to avoid stockouts while being cautious of overstocking. Wholesaler also emphasized the need to align our orders based on observed demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must remain vigilant in adjusting our order quantities to avoid both stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units for the next round to match expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect and better align our order strategies.
- Factory: I hear Retailer mentioned the need to balance order quantities to avoid stockouts while being cautious of overstocking. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the importance of coordinating our orders to match expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while I recognize the potential for increased demand, my current inventory situation is critical as I have none at the moment. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units next round to align with the cautious approach while minimizing my backlog risk.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 240 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [39, 36, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [120]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [89, 86, 70]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 100
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "I have sufficient inventory to meet demand and avoid backlog, while minimizing holding costs.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that recent demand patterns show fluctuations and suggested we adjust our order quantities to avoid stockouts. I also hear Wholesaler agreeing with this observation and proposing to increase order quantities to meet potential spikes in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to better match supply with the expected demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units for the next round to align with this cautious approach while ensuring I have sufficient inventory to meet demand.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize excess inventory and prevent stockouts.
- Factory: I hear Retailer mentioned that there are fluctuations in demand patterns and proposed we adjust our order quantities to avoid stockouts. I also hear Wholesaler agreeing with this observation and suggesting an increase in order quantities to meet potential spikes in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while there is potential for increased demand, my current inventory situation is critical as I have none at the moment. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units next round to align with the cautious approach while attempting to minimize my backlog risk. I suggest we maintain open communication about our inventory levels and demand forecasts to optimize our strategies collectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts weekly to better align our order strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler mentioned that we should consider increasing our order quantities to meet potential spikes in demand, and Distributor echoed the need for caution in matching supply with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while I agree with the importance of aligning our orders to avoid stockouts, we must also be mindful of overstocking given the recent fluctuations in demand. I suggest we continue to share our demand forecasts to better align our strategies. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 30 units for the next round to keep sufficient inventory while avoiding excess.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular demand forecasting meeting to align our order strategies and minimize excess inventory across our supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer mentioned maintaining order quantities to avoid stockouts while being cautious of overstocking due to demand fluctuations. Distributor echoed the need for caution and decided to maintain their order quantity at 50 units, while Factory expressed the urgency of minimizing backlog and will order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all recognize the importance of balancing inventory and demand, we should coordinate closely to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units for the next round to align with the observed trends and ensure we collectively address potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular demand forecasting meeting to share insights and adjust our strategies accordingly to minimize the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 282, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -356.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=Ordering 30 units to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer to avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could lead to increased backlog costs if not anticipated., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=282, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[6, 10, 8], llm_incoming=[38], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 282 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will emphasize my support for establishing a regular meeting to synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will allow us to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's implement a weekly meeting to discuss our demand forecasts and share inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear Wholesaler said that we should enhance communication regarding expected demand forecasts to align our orders better. I also hear Distributor and Retailer support the idea of establishing a regular meeting to synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that open communication is essential to reduce uncertainties and optimize our inventory management. Therefore, I will support the proposal for a weekly meeting to ensure we can align our orders and avoid stockouts, especially given that I currently have 0 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 288 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 40, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [128]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [86, 70, 88]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 80
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 10 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [40, 70, 120, 80]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous communication, so I want to share that our recent demand has been relatively stable with orders of 10, 8, and 9 units. This indicates a moderate consumption trend. Therefore, I believe it’s crucial for us to coordinate on inventory and ordering to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Based on my inventory of 313 units and my strategy, I'm planning to place an order of 30 units this round. I encourage everyone to align their orders to better match demand patterns and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to maintain a strong inventory buffer while anticipating moderate demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts with one another to better synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations in the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 313 units, and I plan to order 30 units this round to meet expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned that their recent demand has been relatively stable with orders of 10, 8, and 9 units, and they plan to order 30 units this round to maintain a strong inventory buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to ensure we are prepared for an expected increase in demand while balancing our inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on projected demand while keeping excess inventory in check.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we create a shared demand forecast document that we can update weekly to better synchronize our orders.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 333 units, and I plan to order 50 units this round to align with projected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said their recent demand has been stable, with orders of 10, 8, and 9 units, and they plan to order 30 units this round. The Wholesaler mentioned that they will maintain their order of 50 units to prepare for expected demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing a need for coordination to manage inventory levels effectively. Therefore, I will order 50 units this round to maintain my inventory buffer while aligning with the expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a strong inventory buffer while being responsive to demand signals.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 319 units, and I plan to order 50 units this round based on the expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said their recent demand has been relatively stable and they plan to order 30 units this round. The Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned their intent to order 50 units to prepare for expected demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for coordination to manage our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to avoid overstocking while responding to the expected lower demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will prioritize maintaining a lean inventory while being responsive to demand signals.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 0 units, and I plan to order 20 units this round based on my assessment of the demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned their intent to order 50 units this round to prepare for expected demand increases, while the Factory is ordering 20 units based on lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the need for coordination to manage our inventories effectively. However, I have a much larger inventory of 313 units and plan to order 30 units, allowing me to maintain a buffer while also being responsive to the current demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to monitor our demand patterns and propose we align our orders to mitigate any potential stockouts or excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory levels while remaining responsive to demand signals.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 313 units, and I plan to order 30 units this round to meet expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned their larger inventory of 313 units and their plan to order 30 units this round while maintaining a buffer. I also note the Distributor's intent to order 50 units to align with expected demand, and the Factory's cautious approach of ordering only 20 units due to lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a clear need for coordination among us to manage inventory levels effectively and mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to prepare for expected demand increases while ensuring we all remain aligned.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on balancing my inventory levels while responding to projected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we regularly update a shared demand forecast document to synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 333 units, and I plan to order 50 units this round to align with projected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 30 units while maintaining a buffer with their larger inventory of 313 units. The Wholesaler is aligning with expected demand by ordering 50 units, and the Factory is taking a cautious approach with an order of 20 units due to lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the importance of coordination to manage our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to align with projected demand while ensuring my inventory buffer remains adequate.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a strong inventory buffer while being responsive to demand signals.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 319 units, and I plan to order 50 units this round based on expected demand.

The Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned they will order 50 units to align with expected demand increases, suggesting a proactive approach to inventory management. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a clear need for us to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units this round to stay responsive to the lower demand expectations while ensuring I can fulfill my commitments without overstocking.
  Strategy Hint: I will prioritize a lean inventory while staying responsive to demand signals.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 313, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -467.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=Ordering 30 units maintains a buffer while covering expected demand and backlog., risk_assessment=Stable demand but potential spikes could lead to stockouts if underestimated., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=313, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10, 8, 9], llm_incoming=[39], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 313 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 319 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 38, 39]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [129]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "Maintaining a buffer inventory to meet expected demand while minimizing costs.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said their recent demand has been stable, with orders of 10, 8, and 9 units, and they plan to order 30 units this round. The Wholesaler mentioned that they will maintain their order of 50 units to prepare for expected demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing a need for coordination to manage inventory levels effectively. Therefore, I will order 50 units this round to maintain my inventory buffer while aligning with the expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said their recent demand has been relatively stable and they plan to order 30 units this round. The Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned their intent to order 50 units to prepare for expected demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for coordination to manage our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to avoid overstocking while responding to the expected lower demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned their intent to order 50 units this round to prepare for expected demand increases, while the Factory is ordering 20 units based on lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the need for coordination to manage our inventories effectively. However, I have a much larger inventory of 313 units and plan to order 30 units, allowing me to maintain a buffer while also being responsive to the current demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to monitor our demand patterns and propose we align our orders to mitigate any potential stockouts or excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned their larger inventory of 313 units and their plan to order 30 units this round while maintaining a buffer. I also note the Distributor's intent to order 50 units to align with expected demand, and the Factory's cautious approach of ordering only 20 units due to lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a clear need for coordination among us to manage inventory levels effectively and mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to prepare for expected demand increases while ensuring we all remain aligned.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly update a shared demand forecast document to synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 30 units while maintaining a buffer with their larger inventory of 313 units. The Wholesaler is aligning with expected demand by ordering 50 units, and the Factory is taking a cautious approach with an order of 20 units due to lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the importance of coordination to manage our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to align with projected demand while ensuring my inventory buffer remains adequate.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have a larger inventory of 313 units and plan to order 30 units this round, which indicates a strong buffer against demand fluctuations. The Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned they will order 50 units to align with expected demand increases, suggesting a proactive approach to inventory management. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a clear need for us to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units this round to stay responsive to the lower demand expectations while ensuring I can fulfill my commitments without overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [70, 88, 89]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 86
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said their recent demand has been stable, with orders of 10, 8, and 9 units, and they plan to order 30 units this round. The Wholesaler mentioned that they will maintain their order of 50 units to prepare for expected demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing a need for coordination to manage inventory levels effectively. Therefore, I will order 50 units this round to maintain my inventory buffer while aligning with the expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said their recent demand has been relatively stable and they plan to order 30 units this round. The Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned their intent to order 50 units to prepare for expected demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for coordination to manage our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to avoid overstocking while responding to the expected lower demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned their intent to order 50 units this round to prepare for expected demand increases, while the Factory is ordering 20 units based on lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the need for coordination to manage our inventories effectively. However, I have a much larger inventory of 313 units and plan to order 30 units, allowing me to maintain a buffer while also being responsive to the current demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to monitor our demand patterns and propose we align our orders to mitigate any potential stockouts or excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned their larger inventory of 313 units and their plan to order 30 units this round while maintaining a buffer. I also note the Distributor's intent to order 50 units to align with expected demand, and the Factory's cautious approach of ordering only 20 units due to lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a clear need for coordination among us to manage inventory levels effectively and mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to prepare for expected demand increases while ensuring we all remain aligned.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly update a shared demand forecast document to synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 30 units while maintaining a buffer with their larger inventory of 313 units. The Wholesaler is aligning with expected demand by ordering 50 units, and the Factory is taking a cautious approach with an order of 20 units due to lower demand expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the importance of coordination to manage our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to align with projected demand while ensuring my inventory buffer remains adequate.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have a larger inventory of 313 units and plan to order 30 units this round, which indicates a strong buffer against demand fluctuations. The Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned they will order 50 units to align with expected demand increases, suggesting a proactive approach to inventory management. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a clear need for us to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units this round to stay responsive to the lower demand expectations while ensuring I can fulfill my commitments without overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for our demand forecasts to help synchronize our orders and minimize fluctuations.
