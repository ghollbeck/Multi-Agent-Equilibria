The Wholesaler and Distributor both mentioned they will order 50 units to align with expected demand increases, suggesting a proactive approach to inventory management. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a clear need for us to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory across the supply chain.
