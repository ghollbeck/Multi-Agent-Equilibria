--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand of 6 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I hear that maintaining a stable inventory is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand trends to adjust our orders accordingly. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to prepare for the expected demand increase while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance inventory levels with expected demand to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units in inventory and no backlog, but I expect demand to rise in the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 6 units and plan to place an order of 20 units to prepare for expected demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be proactive in adjusting our orders to avoid stockouts and manage inventory effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with the anticipated demand and maintain a buffer inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory with expected demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units in inventory and no backlog, and I expect demand to rise in the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 6 units and plan to place an order of 20 units to prepare for expected demand increases. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for proactive order adjustments. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering, as it could lead to excess inventory and increased holding costs. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory with expected demand while minimizing excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units in inventory and no backlog, and I expect demand to rise in the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all mentioned the recent demand of 6 units and their plans to order 20 units to prepare for expected demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all aligned in anticipating higher demand, we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to ensure we have a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while being mindful of our inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory with expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 104 units in inventory and no backlog, and I expect demand to rise in the next round.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 118, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 6, Profit: 30.00, Total Profit: -51.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=To meet expected demand while maintaining a buffer, I will order 20 units., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to overstock or stockouts if not monitored., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=104, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[6], llm_incoming=[6], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order to ensure we can meet this expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been lower than expected, with only 6 units ordered. This indicates a potential shift in consumer behavior. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while keeping an eye on demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 104 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 6 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I hear that maintaining a stable inventory is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand trends to adjust our orders accordingly. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to prepare for the expected demand increase while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order to ensure we can meet this expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been lower than expected, with only 6 units ordered. This indicates a potential shift in consumer behavior. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while keeping an eye on demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 104 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I can meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 2 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 3
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid overstock.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balanced inventory to meet expected demand without excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 125 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging 4.5 units per round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining a balanced inventory to meet expected demand while avoiding overstock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to prevent excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units to align with the expected demand of 20 units next round, while keeping a buffer inventory to manage fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer inventory to meet potential demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us all align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 91 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging 4.5 units per round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their current order quantity of 20 units to align with expected demand while monitoring inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned being cautious about order quantities to prevent excess inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of balancing inventory with demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units to align with the expected demand while keeping a buffer to manage potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer to meet potential demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 71 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging 14.5 units over the last two rounds.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their current order quantity of 20 units to align with expected demand while monitoring inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned being cautious about order quantities to prevent excess inventory and backlog. Additionally, the Distributor echoed the importance of balancing inventory with demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for careful order management to avoid excess stock and potential backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units to ensure I have a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while aligning with the expected demand across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer inventory to manage potential demand fluctuations while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 51 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand/orders averaging 24.5 units over the last two rounds.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 152, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 3, Profit: 15.00, Total Profit: -159.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.7, rationale=To prepare for potential demand spikes while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to overstock or stockouts if not managed., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=125, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[6, 3], llm_incoming=[23], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 125 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 3]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -29.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a possible surge in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we can meet expected demand without overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand while keeping a buffer inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand spikes with orders of 6 and 23 units. This indicates potential fluctuations in demand that we should be prepared for. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I can meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a significant spike in recent demand, with orders reaching 43 units. This indicates potential volatility in future demand. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider adjusting our order quantities to better align with this demand trend. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a possible surge in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we can meet expected demand without overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand while keeping a buffer inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand spikes with orders of 6 and 23 units. This indicates potential fluctuations in demand that we should be prepared for. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I can meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a significant spike in recent demand, with orders reaching 43 units. This indicates potential volatility in future demand. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider adjusting our order quantities to better align with this demand trend. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [6, 6, 6, 26]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of fluctuating demand patterns in recent rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my expected demand for the next round, which is 20 units, and suggest that we all align our orders accordingly.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update mechanism for sharing demand forecasts among all agents to improve our order accuracy.
  Information Shared: I currently have 146 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet the expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and suggested enhancing communication regarding expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our orders could help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to match the expected demand while keeping a buffer inventory to handle fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update mechanism for sharing demand forecasts among all agents to improve our order accuracy.
  Information Shared: I currently have 55 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to meet the expected demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. I also note that the Wholesaler agrees with this approach. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our orders and sharing forecasts will help us all manage our inventories better. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to match the expected demand while keeping a buffer to handle fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update mechanism for sharing demand forecasts among all agents to improve our order accuracy.
  Information Shared: I currently have 5 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to the expected demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. I also note that the Wholesaler and Distributor agree with this approach. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our orders and sharing forecasts is crucial for managing our inventories effectively. However, I currently have a backlog of 25 units and no inventory, which puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to start addressing my backlog while remaining cautious about future demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on my backlog while considering the expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for real-time updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts to improve our order accuracy.
  Information Shared: I currently have a backlog of 25 units and no inventory, which highlights my immediate need to replenish stock.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 146 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 3, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -61.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable inventory and no backlog, I will order to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",
  "risk_assessment": "Demand fluctuations could lead to overstock or stockouts if not monitored closely.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to align with the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 6, 3, and 12 units. This indicates variability that could impact our inventory levels. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with expected demand and reduce the bullwhip effect. By sharing our forecasts, we can optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us all make informed decisions.
- Distributor: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, with orders spiking to 42 units. This indicates potential volatility in the market. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match actual demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to buffer against potential spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity to build a buffer against unexpected demand spikes while managing my backlog effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to align with the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 6, 3, and 12 units. This indicates variability that could impact our inventory levels. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with expected demand and reduce the bullwhip effect. By sharing our forecasts, we can optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us all make informed decisions.
- Distributor: I have observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, with orders spiking to 42 units. This indicates potential volatility in the market. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match actual demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to buffer against potential spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity to build a buffer against unexpected demand spikes while managing my backlog effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (25 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -17.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our forecasts to minimize discrepancies. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to improve our collective planning and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. This aligns with my observation of fluctuating demand patterns, particularly with the last orders being 3, 12, and 4. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be proactive in managing our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand while keeping a buffer inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders peaking at 42 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to better align with these trends and avoid excess backlog. Collaboration on forecasting could help us all manage our inventories more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any risks of backlog and ensure we can meet demand efficiently.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our forecasts to minimize discrepancies. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to improve our collective planning and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. This aligns with my observation of fluctuating demand patterns, particularly with the last orders being 3, 12, and 4. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be proactive in managing our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand while keeping a buffer inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders peaking at 42 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to better align with these trends and avoid excess backlog. Collaboration on forecasting could help us all manage our inventories more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any risks of backlog and ensure we can meet demand efficiently.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we have enough inventory to meet potential spikes in demand while keeping our costs manageable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our ordering strategies and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 42, 24, and 28 units. This indicates a potential for variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while being cautious of excess inventory.

          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 92 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 76.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [72, 54, 48]

          - Last round profit: 135.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent orders and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 20 units to ensure I can meet expected demand without overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in demand patterns. This aligns with my observations of recent orders being inconsistent. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we have enough inventory to meet potential spikes in demand while keeping our costs manageable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our ordering strategies and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 42, 24, and 28 units. This indicates a potential for variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while being cautious of excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce variability in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still managing my costs effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 115 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 54.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to align with expected demand and avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level and place an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this expected demand while minimizing backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing an increase with orders of 24, 28, and 31 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. I hear that the Retailer is concerned about stock levels, which could lead to increased orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while monitoring demand closely.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 121 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [54, 48, 51]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 101.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to align with expected demand and avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level and place an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this expected demand while minimizing backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing an increase with orders of 24, 28, and 31 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. I hear that the Retailer is concerned about stock levels, which could lead to increased orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 131 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 12]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 42.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of information is crucial for our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our order quantities to better match the observed demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid excess stock while meeting demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing an increase with orders of 28, 31, and 32 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. I hear that the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer while being cautious of excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Last round profit: 89.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of information is crucial for our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our order quantities to better match the observed demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid excess stock while meeting demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing an increase with orders of 28, 31, and 32 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. I hear that the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend and avoid stockouts.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns, which have been relatively stable but slightly fluctuating. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to order based on my expected demand while encouraging everyone to share their insights on demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating excess backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders around the low 30s. This suggests a potential for consistent demand in the near future. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. I recommend sharing our expected demand forecasts to align our supply chain efforts more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 109 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 163 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 9]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 29.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns, which have been relatively stable but slightly fluctuating. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to order based on my expected demand while encouraging everyone to share their insights on demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating excess backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders around the low 30s. This suggests a potential for consistent demand in the near future. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. I recommend sharing our expected demand forecasts to align our supply chain efforts more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 109 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 109 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [51, 52, 59]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 91.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns, which have been relatively stable but slightly fluctuating. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to order based on my expected demand while encouraging everyone to share their insights on demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating excess backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders around the low 30s. This suggests a potential for consistent demand in the near future. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. I recommend sharing our expected demand forecasts to align our supply chain efforts more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 109 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 186 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 9]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 18.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet the anticipated demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders and reduce variability in the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating with orders of 32, 29, and 29 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should be cautious of. I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better visibility into demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while being open to adjusting my orders based on collective insights.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 112 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory while still being prepared for demand spikes. Therefore, I will order 20 units to keep a buffer and ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 95.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet the anticipated demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders and reduce variability in the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating with orders of 32, 29, and 29 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should be cautious of. I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better visibility into demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while being open to adjusting my orders based on collective insights.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 112 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory while still being prepared for demand spikes. Therefore, I will order 20 units to keep a buffer and ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders based on observed demand patterns. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid overstock.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balanced inventory to meet stable demand without excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of stable demand at 9 units over the last three rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been consistent at 9 units per round. This suggests a stable demand pattern, which is encouraging. However, I also recognize that fluctuations can occur. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy to buffer against potential spikes in demand while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been consistent at 29 units, which suggests a stable trend. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could lead to backlog if we do not coordinate our orders effectively. Therefore, I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more regularly to align our inventory levels and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to discuss our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we are all aligned.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy to buffer against unexpected demand spikes while placing a conservative order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any sudden increases in demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 226 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 9]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 2.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of stable demand at 9 units over the last three rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been consistent at 9 units per round. This suggests a stable demand pattern, which is encouraging. However, I also recognize that fluctuations can occur. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy to buffer against potential spikes in demand while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been consistent at 29 units, which suggests a stable trend. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could lead to backlog if we do not coordinate our orders effectively. Therefore, I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more regularly to align our inventory levels and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to discuss our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we are all aligned.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy to buffer against unexpected demand spikes while placing a conservative order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any sudden increases in demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [59, 49, 59]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 99.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of stable demand at 9 units over the last three rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been consistent at 9 units per round. This suggests a stable demand pattern, which is encouraging. However, I also recognize that fluctuations can occur. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy to buffer against potential spikes in demand while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been consistent at 29 units, which suggests a stable trend. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could lead to backlog if we do not coordinate our orders effectively. Therefore, I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more regularly to align our inventory levels and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to discuss our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we are all aligned.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy to buffer against unexpected demand spikes while placing a conservative order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any sudden increases in demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 235 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 9]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: -7.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders with actual demand. This aligns with my observation of stable demand at 9 units per round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer inventory to accommodate this potential increase while minimizing backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been consistent at 29 units, which suggests a stable trend. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could lead to backlog if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to discuss our demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my observation of recent orders fluctuating significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy to buffer against these fluctuations while placing a modest order to ensure we are not caught off guard.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders with actual demand. This aligns with my observation of stable demand at 9 units per round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer inventory to accommodate this potential increase while minimizing backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been consistent at 29 units, which suggests a stable trend. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could lead to backlog if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to discuss our demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my observation of recent orders fluctuating significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy to buffer against these fluctuations while placing a modest order to ensure we are not caught off guard.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly, while sharing my expected demand for the next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts among all agents to improve our overall supply chain responsiveness.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent orders of 9, 9, and 13 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a possible spike in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we have enough inventory to meet this anticipated demand while minimizing backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders of 29 and 33 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand in the near future. I encourage everyone to consider maintaining a buffer to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand. Coordination among us can help mitigate the bullwhip effect, especially if we share our forecasts and inventory levels more transparently.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us align our orders and reduce variability.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating, with orders of 59, 38, and 53 units. This indicates potential volatility in the market. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer by ordering 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 261 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 13]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -17.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly, while sharing my expected demand for the next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts among all agents to improve our overall supply chain responsiveness.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent orders of 9, 9, and 13 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a possible spike in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we have enough inventory to meet this anticipated demand while minimizing backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders of 29 and 33 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand in the near future. I encourage everyone to consider maintaining a buffer to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand. Coordination among us can help mitigate the bullwhip effect, especially if we share our forecasts and inventory levels more transparently.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us align our orders and reduce variability.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating, with orders of 59, 38, and 53 units. This indicates potential volatility in the market. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer by ordering 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly, while sharing my expected demand for the next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts among all agents to improve our overall supply chain responsiveness.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent orders of 9, 9, and 13 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a possible spike in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we have enough inventory to meet this anticipated demand while minimizing backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders of 29 and 33 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand in the near future. I encourage everyone to consider maintaining a buffer to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand. Coordination among us can help mitigate the bullwhip effect, especially if we share our forecasts and inventory levels more transparently.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us align our orders and reduce variability.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating, with orders of 59, 38, and 53 units. This indicates potential volatility in the market. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer by ordering 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 268 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -30.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders based on observed demand patterns to minimize excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating with orders of 29, 33, and 31 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand variability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend and avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 212 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [38, 53, 51]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: 47.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders based on observed demand patterns to minimize excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating with orders of 29, 33, and 31 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand variability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend and avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to keep a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on any changes in demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 33, 31, and 39 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I suggest we coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and maintain a more stable supply chain. My current inventory is 372 units, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the risk of backlog.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any backlog risks.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 282 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 19]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [59]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -34.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on any changes in demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 33, 31, and 39 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I suggest we coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and maintain a more stable supply chain. My current inventory is 372 units, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the risk of backlog.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 246 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [53, 51, 59]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [59]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: 34.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on any changes in demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 33, 31, and 39 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I suggest we coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and maintain a more stable supply chain. My current inventory is 372 units, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the risk of backlog.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any backlog risks.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 305 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 19, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -41.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders based on observed demand patterns to minimize excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 31, 39, and 28 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with these trends and reduce the risk of backlog. I currently have 419 units in inventory, which provides a buffer, but I am cautious about future demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels while being prepared for potential demand changes.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 54
          - Last round profit: 37.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders based on observed demand patterns to minimize excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 31, 39, and 28 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with these trends and reduce the risk of backlog. I currently have 419 units in inventory, which provides a buffer, but I am cautious about future demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels while being prepared for potential demand changes.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 313 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [19, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [61]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 2.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with expected demand while maintaining a stable inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 19, 8, and 11 units. This suggests a potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory is crucial to meet these changes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Therefore, I will continue to maintain a buffer inventory while placing an order of 20 units this round to ensure we can meet expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 39, 28, and 41 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with these trends and avoid excess inventory. Collaboration on forecasting could help us all manage our stock levels more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with expected demand while maintaining a stable inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 19, 8, and 11 units. This suggests a potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory is crucial to meet these changes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Therefore, I will continue to maintain a buffer inventory while placing an order of 20 units this round to ensure we can meet expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 39, 28, and 41 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with these trends and avoid excess inventory. Collaboration on forecasting could help us all manage our stock levels more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on shared forecasts.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns showing an increase with orders of 8, 11, and 12 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible increased orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 28, 41, and 32 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should all be prepared for. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. I currently have 497 units in inventory, which gives me a buffer, but I am cautious about future demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with my expected demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders.

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [52]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -56.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on shared forecasts.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns showing an increase with orders of 8, 11, and 12 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible increased orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 28, 41, and 32 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should all be prepared for. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. I currently have 497 units in inventory, which gives me a buffer, but I am cautious about future demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with my expected demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any risks of backlog and ensure we can meet demand efficiently.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on shared forecasts.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns showing an increase with orders of 8, 11, and 12 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible increased orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 28, 41, and 32 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should all be prepared for. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. I currently have 497 units in inventory, which gives me a buffer, but I am cautious about future demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with my expected demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any risks of backlog and ensure we can meet demand efficiently.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 18 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [41, 61, 91, 116]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a stable inventory is crucial for all of us. Given my current inventory of 613 units and recent demand patterns averaging around 10-12 units, I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to better match the expected demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain balance while monitoring demand closely.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to order based on expected demand while keeping inventory levels stable.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 613 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 10-12 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our order quantities is essential to meet the expected demand while minimizing costs. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units this round to ensure I can meet potential demand without overextending my inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory while responding to demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 361 units in inventory with no backlog, and my recent demand has averaged around 10-12 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for alignment in order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of managing our inventories effectively to meet demand without overextending ourselves. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while aligning with the expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to maintain a balance between inventory and demand while minimizing excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 549 units in inventory with no backlog, and my recent demand has averaged around 34 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for alignment in order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of managing our inventories effectively. However, I have observed that my recent demand has been higher than the average mentioned, with recent orders of 61, 52, and 49 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while aligning with the expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to maintain a buffer against demand fluctuations while coordinating with others.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 438 units in inventory with no backlog, and my recent demand has been higher than the average mentioned.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 613 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -230.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of information is crucial for our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our inventory levels and expected demand more frequently to better align our orders. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the collective insights from our supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update schedule for sharing inventory and demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing a slight decrease with orders of 41, 32, and 29 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should monitor closely. I believe it is crucial for us to coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more openly to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all optimize our order quantities.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of information is crucial for our supply chain efficiency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our inventory levels and expected demand more frequently to better align our orders. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the collective insights from our supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update schedule for sharing inventory and demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing a slight decrease with orders of 41, 32, and 29 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should monitor closely. I believe it is crucial for us to coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more openly to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all optimize our order quantities.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 648 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -267.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding demand trends to better align our orders. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the collective insights we share.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level and place an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders of 32, 29, and 28 units. This indicates a slight decrease in demand, which could affect our inventory levels. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this trend and avoid excess inventory. Collaboration on demand forecasting could help us all optimize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level and place an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders of 32, 29, and 28 units. This indicates a slight decrease in demand, which could affect our inventory levels. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this trend and avoid excess inventory. Collaboration on demand forecasting could help us all optimize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 20 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [29, 49, 79, 104]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balanced inventory to meet expected demand without excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 683 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 9-11 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need to closely monitor inventory levels to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our order strategies to better match the expected demand and reduce excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can meet potential demand while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer inventory to meet potential demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 393 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 9-11 units.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 683 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: -292.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher order quantities in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I can meet any unexpected spikes in demand while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 29, 28, and 36 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I suggest we coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and maintain a more stable supply chain. My current inventory is 626 units, which allows me to meet demand without placing excessive orders. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders better and reduce fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any risks of backlog and ensure we can meet demand efficiently.

  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 626 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 28, 36]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -201.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher order quantities in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I can meet any unexpected spikes in demand while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 29, 28, and 36 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. I suggest we coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and maintain a more stable supply chain. My current inventory is 626 units, which allows me to meet demand without placing excessive orders. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders better and reduce fluctuations.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 21 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [28, 48, 78, 98]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on any changes in demand from the Distributor and Factory.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance inventory levels with expected demand to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all make more informed decisions.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 708 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 10.33 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need to closely monitor inventory levels and adjust orders to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our order quantities with the expected demand to maintain a balanced supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units to ensure I can meet potential demand while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to maintain a buffer inventory while being responsive to demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for real-time inventory and demand updates to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 409 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 10.33 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning order quantities with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be proactive in sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and inventory levels. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units for the next round to ensure I can meet potential demand while keeping my inventory manageable.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory while being responsive to demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a shared platform for real-time updates on inventory and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 708 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -291.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher order quantities in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory levels while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated with orders of 28, 36, and 32 units. This variability suggests that we should be cautious in our ordering to avoid excess inventory while still meeting potential demand. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better synchronize our supply chain efforts and minimize backlogs.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my observation of recent orders fluctuating between 48 and 56 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any risks of backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 662 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 36, 32]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -218.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on any changes in demand from the Distributor and Factory.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher order quantities in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory levels while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated with orders of 28, 36, and 32 units. This variability suggests that we should be cautious in our ordering to avoid excess inventory while still meeting potential demand. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better synchronize our supply chain efforts and minimize backlogs.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my observation of recent orders fluctuating between 48 and 56 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any risks of backlog.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 744 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -298.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity to ensure we can meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 36 to 28 units. This suggests a potential shift in consumer behavior. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better align with this trend and avoid excess inventory. Additionally, I have a current inventory of 710 units, which provides a buffer but also indicates that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Let's work together to share demand forecasts more regularly to mitigate the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 710 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 32, 28]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -236.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity to ensure we can meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 36 to 28 units. This suggests a potential shift in consumer behavior. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better align with this trend and avoid excess inventory. Additionally, I have a current inventory of 710 units, which provides a buffer but also indicates that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Let's work together to share demand forecasts more regularly to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all make more informed ordering decisions.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my expected demand for the next round, which is 20 units, and suggest we all align our orders accordingly.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a stable inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 787 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: -340.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to avoid overstock and stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet the anticipated demand while keeping excess stock minimal.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing a slight decrease with orders of 32, 28, and 31 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should monitor closely. I believe it is crucial for us to coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and share demand forecasts, we can better manage our inventory levels and reduce excess stock across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce variability.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 751 units

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to avoid overstock and stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet the anticipated demand while keeping excess stock minimal.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand patterns showing a slight decrease with orders of 32, 28, and 31 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should monitor closely. I believe it is crucial for us to coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and share demand forecasts, we can better manage our inventory levels and reduce excess stock across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce variability.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 827 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: -373.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my expected demand for the next round, which is 20 units, and suggest that we all align our forecasts to better match actual demand.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher order quantities to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand while keeping a buffer in inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing, with orders of 28, 31, and 32 units. This trend suggests a potential rise in demand that we should all prepare for. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory, which can lead to the bullwhip effect. I currently have 787 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet upcoming demand. However, I plan to order only 20 units next round to maintain a buffer while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce fluctuations.
- Factory: I currently have 709 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order conservatively while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 787 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 31, 32]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -280.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my expected demand for the next round, which is 20 units, and suggest that we all align our forecasts to better match actual demand.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher order quantities to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand while keeping a buffer in inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing, with orders of 28, 31, and 32 units. This trend suggests a potential rise in demand that we should all prepare for. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory, which can lead to the bullwhip effect. I currently have 787 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet upcoming demand. However, I plan to order only 20 units next round to maintain a buffer while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce fluctuations.
- Factory: I currently have 709 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order conservatively while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 860 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -385.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 827 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 32, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [81]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -298.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to balance between meeting demand and avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [32, 52, 82, 103]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations, which have been 7, 11, and 12 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on improving our communication regarding demand signals to avoid overstock and stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet expected demand while minimizing excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a stable inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 889 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -379.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations, which have been increasing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing more accurate demand data to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our collective decision-making.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 7, 11, and 12 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should be aware of. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory is crucial to meet these demands without incurring backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we are not overreacting to demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to buffer against potential increases in demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable with orders around 31-32 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand moving forward. However, I also recognize that fluctuations can occur, which could impact our inventory levels. Therefore, I recommend that we all keep a close eye on our inventory and order patterns to avoid any potential backlogs. Collaboration in sharing demand forecasts could help us mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to better align our orders and reduce variability.
- Factory: I currently have a strong inventory of 793 units and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory and potential waste. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 868 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 31, 32]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 31
          - Last round profit: -319.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations, which have been increasing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing more accurate demand data to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our collective decision-making.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns showing fluctuations with orders of 7, 11, and 12 units. This indicates potential variability in demand that we should be aware of. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory is crucial to meet these demands without incurring backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we are not overreacting to demand spikes. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to buffer against potential increases in demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable with orders around 31-32 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand moving forward. However, I also recognize that fluctuations can occur, which could impact our inventory levels. Therefore, I recommend that we all keep a close eye on our inventory and order patterns to avoid any potential backlogs. Collaboration in sharing demand forecasts could help us mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to better align our orders and reduce variability.
- Factory: I currently have a strong inventory of 793 units and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory and potential waste. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a stable inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce variability in the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 919 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 10.67 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and the importance of enhancing communication to minimize the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders more closely with expected demand to avoid excess stock and potential backlog costs. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory levels and adjust my order quantity to better match the anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to adjust my orders based on collaborative demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve coordination across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 526 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 10.67 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. I also note that the Wholesaler agrees on the importance of aligning orders with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our demand forecasts more regularly to optimize our inventory levels and reduce variability. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to meet potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer while adjusting orders based on collaborative demand forecasts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve coordination across the supply chain.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. I also note that the Wholesaler agrees on the importance of aligning orders with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid excess stock and potential backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my current strategy of ordering 20 units to keep a buffer against demand fluctuations while ensuring I have sufficient inventory to meet the expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively while maintaining a buffer to manage demand variability.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve coordination across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 835 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 50.67 units.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 919 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -388.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly, while sharing my expected demand for the next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable with orders of 11, 12, and 9 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand in the near future. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our order quantities and reduce fluctuations in inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating with orders of 31, 32, and 29 units. This indicates a potential trend of decreasing demand. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. By sharing our expected demand, we can better align our supply chain efforts. I currently have 912 units in inventory and a backlog of 0, which gives me a buffer to meet potential demand. However, I am cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain my inventory without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 912 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 32, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [81]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 32
          - Last round profit: -340.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly, while sharing my expected demand for the next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable with orders of 11, 12, and 9 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand in the near future. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our order quantities and reduce fluctuations in inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating with orders of 31, 32, and 29 units. This indicates a potential trend of decreasing demand. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. By sharing our expected demand, we can better align our supply chain efforts. I currently have 912 units in inventory and a backlog of 0, which gives me a buffer to meet potential demand. However, I am cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain my inventory without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to mitigate any unexpected spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding expected demand to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on shared forecasts.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 955 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 9.33 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and the importance of enhancing communication to minimize the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prioritize sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our strategies more effectively. Therefore, I will continue to maintain a buffer inventory while adjusting my orders based on the expected demand of 20 units for the next round.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer inventory while closely monitoring demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 551 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 9.33 units.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 955 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -420.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 12 to 7 units. I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns showing a slight decrease with orders of 12, 9, and 7 units. This trend suggests we may need to adjust our strategies to avoid excess inventory. I hear that the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I can meet potential spikes in demand while keeping my inventory manageable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 32 to 27 units. This suggests a potential shift in consumer behavior that we should all be aware of. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to better match this declining demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 20 units to align with the expected demand and avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 958 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 29, 27]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -361.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 12 to 7 units. I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand patterns showing a slight decrease with orders of 12, 9, and 7 units. This trend suggests we may need to adjust our strategies to avoid excess inventory. I hear that the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I can meet potential spikes in demand while keeping my inventory manageable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 32 to 27 units. This suggests a potential shift in consumer behavior that we should all be aware of. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to better match this declining demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 20 units to align with the expected demand and avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any unexpected spikes in demand while still placing a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [29, 49, 81, 100]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing a slight decline. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing more accurate demand data to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet expected demand while minimizing excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a balanced inventory while preparing for potential demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 991 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 7 units per round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and the importance of sharing accurate demand data to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication regarding demand trends to align our orders more effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units while closely monitoring inventory levels and demand patterns.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a buffer inventory while being responsive to demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should focus on sharing more accurate demand data to avoid overstocking or stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned enhancing communication regarding demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders more effectively to manage our inventories and meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 1003 units while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet potential fluctuations in demand without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer to meet potential demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should focus on sharing more accurate demand data to avoid overstocking or stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned enhancing communication regarding demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders more effectively to manage our inventories and meet demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 897 units and place an order of 20 units to ensure I have a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while also being responsive to the recent average demand of 47 units per round.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer inventory while being responsive to demand changes.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 991 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -449.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing more accurate demand data to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet expected demand while minimizing excess stock.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 29 to 26 units. This suggests a potential shift in consumer behavior that we should all be aware of. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and potential backlogs. If we can align our expectations on demand, we can mitigate the bullwhip effect. I am currently holding 1003 units in inventory, which gives me a buffer, but I am cautious about future demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I currently have 897 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to keep a stable supply while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1003 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 27, 26]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [76]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -384.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand patterns showing a slight decline. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing more accurate demand data to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to meet expected demand while minimizing excess stock.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible spikes in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet any unexpected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 29 to 26 units. This suggests a potential shift in consumer behavior that we should all be aware of. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and potential backlogs. If we can align our expectations on demand, we can mitigate the bullwhip effect. I am currently holding 1003 units in inventory, which gives me a buffer, but I am cautious about future demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I currently have 897 units in inventory and no backlog. I hear that maintaining a buffer against potential demand fluctuations is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to keep a stable supply while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

External demand (Retailer): 5
Shipments received per agent: [27, 47, 77, 67]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of information is crucial for our supply chain efficiency. I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders of 7, 6, and 5 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a potential drop in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid overstock.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while monitoring inventory closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 1027 units in inventory and no backlog, with an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders and will adjust their order quantity accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about potential drops in demand and align our orders to avoid excess inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1027 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 6, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [25]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -472.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand trends showing a slight decrease. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing more accurate demand data to avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 7, 6, and 5 units. This suggests a potential decline in demand that we should all be aware of. I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better inventory management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to align with the observed demand trend. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory while being cautious of the declining demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing slightly over the last three rounds, with recent demands of 27, 26, and 25 units. I believe this indicates a potential stabilization in demand. Therefore, I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid overreacting to these fluctuations, which could lead to excess inventory and increased costs for all of us. I am currently holding 1040 units in inventory, which gives me a buffer to meet any unexpected demand. I encourage everyone to share their current inventory levels and expected demand to better align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my observation of recent orders averaging around 46 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we have a buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1040 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [27, 26, 25]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: -404.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. This aligns with my observations of recent demand trends showing a slight decrease. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all focus on sharing more accurate demand data to avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us all align our orders more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 7, 6, and 5 units. This suggests a potential decline in demand that we should all be aware of. I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better inventory management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to align with the observed demand trend. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory while being cautious of the declining demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing slightly over the last three rounds, with recent demands of 27, 26, and 25 units. I believe this indicates a potential stabilization in demand. Therefore, I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid overreacting to these fluctuations, which could lead to excess inventory and increased costs for all of us. I am currently holding 1040 units in inventory, which gives me a buffer to meet any unexpected demand. I encourage everyone to share their current inventory levels and expected demand to better align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. This aligns with my observation of recent orders averaging around 46 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure we have a buffer while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.
