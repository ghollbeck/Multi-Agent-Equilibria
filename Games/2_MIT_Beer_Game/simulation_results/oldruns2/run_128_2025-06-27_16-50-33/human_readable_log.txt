--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 41 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $2.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while ensuring I can meet current orders without risking stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
  Information Shared: I have 41 units in inventory and no backlog, and I plan to order 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will also order 20 units to maintain a buffer and meet potential demand, while being mindful of my current profit of $-25.00 and my inventory of 50 units with no backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while ensuring we avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 50 units in inventory and no backlog, and I plan to order 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned on maintaining a buffer, but we must be cautious about the potential for oversupply and its impact on our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units to the Factory to ensure we can meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory stable and avoiding backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while ensuring we avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs, and Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are aligned on maintaining a buffer, we must be cautious about the potential for oversupply and its impact on our profits. My current profit is $-25.00, and I have 50 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will produce 20 units to meet the expected demand while ensuring we do not create excess stock that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 50 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit so far is $-25.00.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 41 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while ensuring I can meet current orders without risking stock-outs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 50 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 50 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 41 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $2.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while ensuring I can meet current orders without risking stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will also order 20 units to maintain a buffer and meet potential demand, while being mindful of my current profit of $-25.00 and my inventory of 50 units with no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned on maintaining a buffer, but we must be cautious about the potential for oversupply and its impact on our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units to the Factory to ensure we can meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory stable and avoiding backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs, and Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are aligned on maintaining a buffer, we must be cautious about the potential for oversupply and its impact on our profits. My current profit is $-25.00, and I have 50 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will produce 20 units to meet the expected demand while ensuring we do not create excess stock that could lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid the bullwhip effect.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 34 units and place an order of 20 units to keep a buffer for expected demand while minimizing the risk of stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to maintain a buffer and avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess backlog or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $2.50 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without causing excess backlog or stock-outs. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 30 units and place an order of 20 units to keep a buffer for expected demand while minimizing the risk of stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to maintain a buffer and avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess backlog or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $10.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to keep a buffer for expected demand, while also being mindful of our shipment constraints. We need to communicate our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products through the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to maintain a buffer and avoid stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand and keep my inventory at a manageable level, while also being mindful of the shipment constraints that limit us to shipping only the downstream order plus any backlog.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 34 units and place an order of 20 units to keep a buffer for expected demand while minimizing the risk of stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess backlog or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without causing excess backlog or stock-outs. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 30 units and place an order of 20 units to keep a buffer for expected demand while minimizing the risk of stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess backlog or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to keep a buffer for expected demand, while also being mindful of our shipment constraints. We need to communicate our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products through the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities and share demand forecasts to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess backlog or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand and keep my inventory at a manageable level, while also being mindful of the shipment constraints that limit us to shipping only the downstream order plus any backlog.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess backlog or stock-outs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($10.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (30 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $30.50 and an inventory of 19 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 19 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while coordinating with others to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders to avoid potential stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a steady flow of inventory while avoiding excessive costs. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is $55.00, and I have 10 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to prevent any disruptions.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 19 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 20, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $30.50 and an inventory of 19 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a steady flow of inventory while avoiding excessive costs. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is $55.00, and I have 10 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a steady flow of inventory while avoiding excessive costs. My current profit is $55.00, and I have 10 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. We need to be cautious of potential stockouts and oversupply, as these can threaten our profits and lead to market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 20, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $30.50 and an inventory of 19 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to stabilize our supply chain.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a steady flow of inventory while avoiding excessive costs. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is $55.00, and I have 10 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to prevent any disruptions.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $44.00 and an inventory of 28 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 28 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. To prevent this, I propose we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share forecasts to prevent excess inventory and stock-outs.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit is $65.00, but I am facing a backlog of 10 units and have 0 inventory, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on recent demand trends while managing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on expected demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 20, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $44.00 and an inventory of 28 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. To prevent this, I propose we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share forecasts to prevent excess inventory and stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit is $65.00, but I am facing a backlog of 10 units and have 0 inventory, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on expected demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Distributor also mentioned the risk of stock-outs due to their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit is $65.00, but I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 20, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $44.00 and an inventory of 28 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. To prevent this, I propose we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share forecasts to prevent excess inventory and stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit is $65.00, but I am facing a backlog of 10 units and have 0 inventory, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on expected demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Distributor also mentioned the risk of stock-outs due to their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit is $65.00, but I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 20, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $44.00 and an inventory of 28 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. To prevent this, I propose we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share forecasts to prevent excess inventory and stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit is $65.00, but I am facing a backlog of 10 units and have 0 inventory, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on expected demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Distributor also mentioned the risk of stock-outs due to their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit is $65.00, but I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $35.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 43 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain. I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to avoid disruptions. Let's work together to keep our supply chain flowing smoothly and avoid any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to minimize risks.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs, especially since they currently have a backlog of 25 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that our orders reflect the expected demand while considering our current inventory and backlog situations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our order quantities to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a collective expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize risks and maximize our total profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 35 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to increased backlog costs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs, especially since they currently have a backlog of 25 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units puts me at risk of not being able to fulfill future demand, which could threaten my profit of $5.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory or further backlog. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits while preventing any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 43 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 11, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $35.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain. I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to avoid disruptions. Let's work together to keep our supply chain flowing smoothly and avoid any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to minimize risks.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs, especially since they currently have a backlog of 25 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that our orders reflect the expected demand while considering our current inventory and backlog situations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our order quantities to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a collective expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize risks and maximize our total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs, especially since they currently have a backlog of 25 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units puts me at risk of not being able to fulfill future demand, which could threaten my profit of $5.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory or further backlog. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits while preventing any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a collective expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize risks and maximize our total profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 35 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (35 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $35.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain. I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to avoid disruptions. Let's work together to keep our supply chain flowing smoothly and avoid any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to minimize risks.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs, especially since they currently have a backlog of 25 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that our orders reflect the expected demand while considering our current inventory and backlog situations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our order quantities to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a collective expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize risks and maximize our total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs, especially since they currently have a backlog of 25 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units puts me at risk of not being able to fulfill future demand, which could threaten my profit of $5.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory or further backlog. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits while preventing any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a collective expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize risks and maximize our total profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 40 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (40 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $35.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain. I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to avoid disruptions. Let's work together to keep our supply chain flowing smoothly and avoid any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to minimize risks.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs, especially since they currently have a backlog of 25 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that our orders reflect the expected demand while considering our current inventory and backlog situations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our order quantities to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a collective expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize risks and maximize our total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent stock-outs, especially since they currently have a backlog of 25 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units puts me at risk of not being able to fulfill future demand, which could threaten my profit of $5.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory or further backlog. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits while preventing any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a collective expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to minimize risks and maximize our total profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $44.50 and an inventory of 41 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 41 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent further backlog and stabilize our supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 45 units, which is threatening my profit trajectory of $-32.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying, while also considering the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to reduce backlog while maintaining a buffer for expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 45 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for effective order alignment to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply. My current profit is $-107.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 80 units, which threatens my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire chain's profitability. We need to be cautious about stock-outs and oversupply, as these could lead to market instability and further losses for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize supply.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock and prevent backlog issues.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 80 units, which significantly affects my ability to fulfill orders.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of effective order alignment to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all work together to ensure we have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. My current profit is $-137.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 95 units, which significantly threatens my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 41 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 5, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 45 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (45 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $44.50 and an inventory of 41 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent further backlog and stabilize our supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 45 units, which is threatening my profit trajectory of $-32.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying, while also considering the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for effective order alignment to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply. My current profit is $-107.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 80 units, which threatens my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire chain's profitability. We need to be cautious about stock-outs and oversupply, as these could lead to market instability and further losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock and prevent backlog issues.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of effective order alignment to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all work together to ensure we have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. My current profit is $-137.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 95 units, which significantly threatens my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply. We need to be cautious about stock-outs and oversupply, as these could lead to market instability and further losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all have enough stock and prevent backlog issues.

Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent further backlog and stabilize our supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 45 units, which is threatening my profit trajectory of $-32.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying, while also considering the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for effective order alignment to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply. My current profit is $-107.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 80 units, which threatens my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire chain's profitability. We need to be cautious about stock-outs and oversupply, as these could lead to market instability and further losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock and prevent backlog issues.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of effective order alignment to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all work together to ensure we have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. My current profit is $-137.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 95 units, which significantly threatens my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply. We need to be cautious about stock-outs and oversupply, as these could lead to market instability and further losses for all of us.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 95 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (95 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 5. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 95 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Total profit so far: $-137.50

}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $51.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand without stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have a profit of $-118.00, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stockouts if we do not manage our orders carefully. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid oversupply or stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units, which impacts our ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address my current situation of having 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 145 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-325.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stockouts or oversupply. We need to be mindful that I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, and with orders taking 1 round to arrive, we must plan carefully to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in supply.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of production. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $-415.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 185 units, which significantly impacts our ability to fulfill orders.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 57 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 65
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (57 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $51.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have a profit of $-118.00, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stockouts if we do not manage our orders carefully. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid oversupply or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address my current situation of having 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 145 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-325.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stockouts or oversupply. We need to be mindful that I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, and with orders taking 1 round to arrive, we must plan carefully to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in supply.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain, and the Distributor highlighted the urgency of addressing their backlog of 145 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of production. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $-415.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 185 units, which significantly impacts our ability to fulfill orders. We need to be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 145 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 90
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (145 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $51.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have a profit of $-118.00, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stockouts if we do not manage our orders carefully. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid oversupply or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address my current situation of having 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 145 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-325.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stockouts or oversupply. We need to be mindful that I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, and with orders taking 1 round to arrive, we must plan carefully to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in supply.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain, and the Distributor highlighted the urgency of addressing their backlog of 145 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of production. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $-415.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 185 units, which significantly impacts our ability to fulfill orders. We need to be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.

3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 185 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [185]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 105
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (185 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $51.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have a profit of $-118.00, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stockouts if we do not manage our orders carefully. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid oversupply or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address my current situation of having 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 145 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-325.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stockouts or oversupply. We need to be mindful that I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, and with orders taking 1 round to arrive, we must plan carefully to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in supply.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain, and the Distributor highlighted the urgency of addressing their backlog of 145 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of production. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is $-415.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 185 units, which significantly impacts our ability to fulfill orders. We need to be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 25 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $56.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I have 25 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $56.00.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 77 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at -$233.50. If we do not align our orders, we risk stockouts and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders with the Retailer to stabilize inventory levels and reduce backlog costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maximize our profits and prevent stockouts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 77 units, which is affecting my profit negatively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit stands at -$658.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 222 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to further losses for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of supply.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "I have sufficient inventory to meet current demand and avoid stock-outs. I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 25 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $56.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 77 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at -$233.50. If we do not align our orders, we risk stockouts and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maximize our profits and prevent stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit stands at -$658.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 222 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to further losses for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of supply.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 222 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 165
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (222 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 25 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $56.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 77 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at -$233.50. If we do not align our orders, we risk stockouts and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maximize our profits and prevent stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit stands at -$658.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 222 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to further losses for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of supply.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maximize our profits and prevent stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 350 units and zero inventory is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, which stands at -$940.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory and to prevent further losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maximize our profits and prevent stockouts.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 350 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [350]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 205
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (350 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 25 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $56.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 77 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at -$233.50. If we do not align our orders, we risk stockouts and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maximize our profits and prevent stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit stands at -$658.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 222 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to further losses for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of supply.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we all maximize our profits and prevent stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 350 units and zero inventory is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, which stands at -$940.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory and to prevent further losses for all of us.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $70.50 and an inventory of 16 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a stable supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 89 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-367.00. If we do not manage our orders carefully, we risk stockouts and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain and minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 89 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts and increased costs.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the risk of stockouts and increased backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and avoid further losses. My current profit is $-1136.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 319 units, which significantly threatens my ability to fulfill orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and prevent a collapse in our supply chain. We need to ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive costs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor expressing concerns about stockouts and backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to stabilize the supply chain and prevent further losses. My current profit is $-1798.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 572 units, which significantly threatens my ability to fulfill orders and impacts all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 89 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 97
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (89 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 572 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [572]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 370
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (572 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 5 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $95.50 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on the current backlog and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and avoid further losses.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on minimizing backlog costs while ensuring we meet demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 98 units, with a total profit of $-514.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. I also heard the Wholesaler propose aligning our order quantities based on our current backlog and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our operations and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking, while being mindful of my current situation of 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 428 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-1778.50.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 5 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 98 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 109
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (98 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on the current backlog and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. I also heard the Wholesaler propose aligning our order quantities based on our current backlog and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our operations and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking, while being mindful of my current situation of 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 428 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-1778.50.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor propose aligning our order quantities based on our current backlog and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our operations and prevent further losses. My current profit is $-3164.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 911 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking, while being mindful of our shipment constraints. We must avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow to keep our profits from collapsing.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 428 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 339
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (428 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on the current backlog and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. I also heard the Wholesaler propose aligning our order quantities based on our current backlog and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our operations and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking, while being mindful of my current situation of 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 428 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-1778.50.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor propose aligning our order quantities based on our current backlog and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our operations and prevent further losses. My current profit is $-3164.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 911 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking, while being mindful of our shipment constraints. We must avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow to keep our profits from collapsing.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on the current backlog and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. I also heard the Wholesaler propose aligning our order quantities based on our current backlog and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our operations and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking, while being mindful of my current situation of 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 428 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-1778.50.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure we meet customer demand. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor propose aligning our order quantities based on our current backlog and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our operations and prevent further losses. My current profit is $-3164.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 911 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking, while being mindful of our shipment constraints. We must avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow to keep our profits from collapsing.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units. My profit so far is $103.50, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the recent demand trends while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise and emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 109 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. This situation threatens my profit trajectory of $-677.50 and could lead to further losses if not addressed. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders based on shared demand expectations to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 109 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise and emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their significant backlog of 109 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current situation is critical, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 546 units, which severely impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit of $-2597.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. We must avoid oversupply and stock-outs to prevent a collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders based on shared demand expectations to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs.

Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their critical situation with a backlog of 546 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent oversupply, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1359 units, which severely impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit of $-5203.00.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 3 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (3 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise and emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their significant backlog of 109 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current situation is critical, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 546 units, which severely impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit of $-2597.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. We must avoid oversupply and stock-outs to prevent a collapse that would hurt all of us.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 109 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 118
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (109 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 546 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 448
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (546 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units. My profit so far is $103.50, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise and emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 109 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. This situation threatens my profit trajectory of $-677.50 and could lead to further losses if not addressed. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise and emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their significant backlog of 109 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current situation is critical, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 546 units, which severely impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit of $-2597.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. We must avoid oversupply and stock-outs to prevent a collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise, and the Wholesaler mentioned their significant backlog of 109 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their critical situation with a backlog of 546 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent oversupply, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1359 units, which severely impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit of $-5203.00. We must work together to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits while avoiding a collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid stock-outs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1359 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [1359]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 911
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1359 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units. My profit so far is $103.50, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise and emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 109 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. This situation threatens my profit trajectory of $-677.50 and could lead to further losses if not addressed. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise and emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their significant backlog of 109 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current situation is critical, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 546 units, which severely impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit of $-2597.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. We must avoid oversupply and stock-outs to prevent a collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise, and the Wholesaler mentioned their significant backlog of 109 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their critical situation with a backlog of 546 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent oversupply, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1359 units, which severely impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit of $-5203.00. We must work together to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits while avoiding a collapse that would hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid stock-outs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens my profit of $79.50. If I cannot meet demand, it will impact all of us. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs associated with holding and backlog.
  Information Shared: I am currently facing a backlog of 16 units and have no inventory, which could lead to stock-outs if not addressed promptly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens their profit. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 119 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-856.00. If we do not align our orders, we risk stock-outs and increased backlog costs for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the need to replenish inventory while considering the backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs associated with holding and backlog.
  Information Shared: I am currently facing a backlog of 119 units and have no inventory, which could lead to stock-outs if not addressed promptly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens their profit. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 119 units, significantly impacting their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical inventory shortages and high backlogs, which could lead to stock-outs and increased costs for everyone. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 675 units, which severely threatens my profit of $-3610.00. We need to align our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid a collapse that would hurt us all.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on coordinating orders to stabilize supply and minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I am currently facing a backlog of 675 units and have no inventory, which could lead to stock-outs if not addressed promptly.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens their profit. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 119 units, significantly impacting their profit trajectory. Furthermore, the Distributor stated they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 675 units, which severely threatens their profit. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical inventory shortages and high backlogs, which could lead to stock-outs and increased costs for everyone. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our production and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-8090.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1925 units, which puts me at risk of further losses. We need to align our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid a collapse that would hurt us all.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 129
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (119 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens my profit of $79.50. If I cannot meet demand, it will impact all of us. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs associated with holding and backlog.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens their profit. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 119 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-856.00. If we do not align our orders, we risk stock-outs and increased backlog costs for all of us.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1925 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [1925]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1360
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1925 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens my profit of $79.50. If I cannot meet demand, it will impact all of us. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs associated with holding and backlog.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens their profit. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 119 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-856.00. If we do not align our orders, we risk stock-outs and increased backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs associated with holding and backlog.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which threatens their profit. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 119 units, significantly impacting their profit trajectory. Furthermore, the Distributor stated they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 675 units, which severely threatens their profit. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical inventory shortages and high backlogs, which could lead to stock-outs and increased costs for everyone. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our production and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

External demand (Retailer): 9
Orders received per agent: [9, 0, 0, 0]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 2719]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units. My profit so far is $42.00, but I am at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed my orders. I hear no previous messages from other agents, which indicates a lack of communication that could lead to inefficiencies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the recent demand trends while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could impact the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which indicates a risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, as my current profit is $-1088.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 155 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could impact the entire supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to meet the Retailer's needs while managing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 155 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to further losses.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 155 units. This indicates a significant risk of stock-outs across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit is $-4831.00 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 814 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, ensuring we all avoid further losses.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to meet the immediate needs of the Wholesaler and Retailer while managing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which indicates a risk of stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about their backlogs and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks of stock-outs, which could lead to further losses across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the actual demand and prevent excess backlog, as my current profit is $-12020.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2620 units. This situation threatens not only my profit but the entire supply chain's stability. We need to work together to ensure that our orders reflect the demand accurately and avoid the bullwhip effect. I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream orders plus my backlog, so we must plan our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow and minimize holding and backlog costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 25 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (25 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 155 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 139
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (155 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units. My profit so far is $42.00, but I am at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed my orders. I hear no previous messages from other agents, which indicates a lack of communication that could lead to inefficiencies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which indicates a risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, as my current profit is $-1088.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 155 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could impact the entire supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 155 units. This indicates a significant risk of stock-outs across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit is $-4831.00 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 814 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, ensuring we all avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which indicates a risk of stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about their backlogs and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks of stock-outs, which could lead to further losses across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the actual demand and prevent excess backlog, as my current profit is $-12020.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2620 units. This situation threatens not only my profit but the entire supply chain's stability. We need to work together to ensure that our orders reflect the demand accurately and avoid the bullwhip effect. I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream orders plus my backlog, so we must plan our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow and minimize holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 814 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 695
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (814 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units. My profit so far is $42.00, but I am at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed my orders. I hear no previous messages from other agents, which indicates a lack of communication that could lead to inefficiencies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which indicates a risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, as my current profit is $-1088.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 155 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could impact the entire supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 155 units. This indicates a significant risk of stock-outs across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit is $-4831.00 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 814 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, ensuring we all avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which indicates a risk of stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about their backlogs and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks of stock-outs, which could lead to further losses across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the actual demand and prevent excess backlog, as my current profit is $-12020.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2620 units. This situation threatens not only my profit but the entire supply chain's stability. We need to work together to ensure that our orders reflect the demand accurately and avoid the bullwhip effect. I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream orders plus my backlog, so we must plan our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow and minimize holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.

          - Incoming shipments this round: [2620]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1945
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2620 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units. My profit so far is $42.00, but I am at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed my orders. I hear no previous messages from other agents, which indicates a lack of communication that could lead to inefficiencies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which indicates a risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, as my current profit is $-1088.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 155 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could impact the entire supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 155 units. This indicates a significant risk of stock-outs across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit is $-4831.00 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 814 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, ensuring we all avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 25 units, which indicates a risk of stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about their backlogs and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks of stock-outs, which could lead to further losses across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the actual demand and prevent excess backlog, as my current profit is $-12020.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2620 units. This situation threatens not only my profit but the entire supply chain's stability. We need to work together to ensure that our orders reflect the demand accurately and avoid the bullwhip effect. I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream orders plus my backlog, so we must plan our orders carefully to maintain a steady flow and minimize holding and backlog costs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs. My profit so far is $-6.00, and I need to ensure that we coordinate effectively to avoid oversupply and maintain steady demand. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial, but I am currently unable to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and potential stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

          - Backlog: 32 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (32 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs. My profit so far is $-6.00, and I need to ensure that we coordinate effectively to avoid oversupply and maintain steady demand. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial, but I am currently unable to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and potential stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 994 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 834
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (994 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs. My profit so far is $-6.00, and I need to ensure that we coordinate effectively to avoid oversupply and maintain steady demand. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial, but I am currently unable to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and potential stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. This situation is critical as it affects the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent further backlog and potential stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we are all meeting demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased costs for all of us.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 200 units, significantly impacting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical supply challenges that could lead to a collapse in our supply chain if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for us to align our orders based on our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 200 units, significantly impacting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical supply challenges that could lead to a collapse in our supply chain if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for us to align our production and order quantities based on our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 3454 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [3454]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 2620
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (3454 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs. My profit so far is $-6.00, and I need to ensure that we coordinate effectively to avoid oversupply and maintain steady demand. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial, but I am currently unable to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and potential stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. This situation is critical as it affects the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent further backlog and potential stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we are all meeting demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased costs for all of us.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 200 units, significantly impacting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical supply challenges that could lead to a collapse in our supply chain if we do not coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for us to align our orders based on our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-72.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 44 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize fluctuations and stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 44 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill customer demand and affects the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1766.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 252 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to minimize fluctuations and stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on my backlog and expected demand to avoid further losses.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further losses. My current profit is $-8161.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1226 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to minimize fluctuations and ensure a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on current backlogs and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 44 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 52
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (44 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 252 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 232
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (252 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-72.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 44 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize fluctuations and stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1766.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 252 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to minimize fluctuations and stabilize our supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4468 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4468]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 3454
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4468 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-72.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 44 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize fluctuations and stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-151.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 53 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without excess inventory.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 53 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 64
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (53 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 316 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 272
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (316 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-151.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 53 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-2240.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 316 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our ordering strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders carefully to prevent further losses, as my current profit is $-10408.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1498 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory, while also being mindful of our shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the current backlog of 5714 units while being mindful of our shipment constraints. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory, as my current profit is $-32474.50 and I have 0 units in inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order schedules to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1498 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1246
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1498 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-151.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 53 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-2240.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 316 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our ordering strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders carefully to prevent further losses, as my current profit is $-10408.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1498 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory, while also being mindful of our shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the current backlog of 5714 units while being mindful of our shipment constraints. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory, as my current profit is $-32474.50 and I have 0 units in inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order schedules to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-2240.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 316 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our ordering strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders carefully to prevent further losses, as my current profit is $-10408.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1498 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory, while also being mindful of our shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the current backlog of 5714 units while being mindful of our shipment constraints. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory, as my current profit is $-32474.50 and I have 0 units in inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order schedules to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 8936]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current profit of $-252.00 and my inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 67 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact the entire supply chain. I propose that we coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. Remember, a collapse in the supply chain hurts everyone's profits. I can only ship orders plus my backlog, so timely communication is crucial. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and minimize costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 67 units, which affects the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, highlighting their current profit of $-252.00 and their inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 67 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs, which could negatively impact our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. My current profit is $-2824.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 389 units, which affects the entire supply chain. We need to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and minimize costs, as a collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders to meet demand while managing backlog costs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern, highlighting their own backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks of stock-outs, which could severely impact our profits. My current profit is $-13159.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1834 units. This situation threatens not only my profit trajectory but also the stability of the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.

Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and order quantities more closely to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. My current inventory is 0 units with a backlog of 7232 units, which affects our ability to fulfill downstream orders. We must share our demand forecasts and align our strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow. Remember, a collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 67 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 73
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (67 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, highlighting their current profit of $-252.00 and their inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 67 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs, which could negatively impact our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. My current profit is $-2824.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 389 units, which affects the entire supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 389 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 336
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (389 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1834 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1518
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1834 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current profit of $-252.00 and my inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 67 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact the entire supply chain. I propose that we coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. Remember, a collapse in the supply chain hurts everyone's profits. I can only ship orders plus my backlog, so timely communication is crucial. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and minimize costs.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, highlighting their current profit of $-252.00 and their inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 67 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs, which could negatively impact our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. My current profit is $-2824.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 389 units, which affects the entire supply chain.

  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern, highlighting their own backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks of stock-outs, which could severely impact our profits. My current profit is $-13159.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1834 units. This situation threatens not only my profit trajectory but also the stability of the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We need to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. Remember, a collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, highlighting their own backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at significant risk of stock-outs, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-43322.50 and the stability of the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and order quantities more closely to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. My current inventory is 0 units with a backlog of 7232 units, which affects our ability to fulfill downstream orders. We must share our demand forecasts and align our strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow. Remember, a collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 7232 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7232]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 5714
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (7232 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current profit of $-252.00 and my inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 67 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact the entire supply chain. I propose that we coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We should share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. Remember, a collapse in the supply chain hurts everyone's profits. I can only ship orders plus my backlog, so timely communication is crucial. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, highlighting their current profit of $-252.00 and their inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 67 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs, which could negatively impact our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. My current profit is $-2824.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 389 units, which affects the entire supply chain.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit is at $-361.50, and I currently have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 73 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can avoid unnecessary fluctuations. This will help stabilize our operations and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while considering the lead time.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and stabilize our operations. My current profit is at $-3526.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 468 units. This situation puts pressure on the entire supply chain, and if we do not act collaboratively, we risk a collapse that will hurt everyone's profits. We must be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to ensure a steady flow and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the Retailer's situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 468 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, and Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 468 units. This situation threatens our ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is at $-16523.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2243 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. We must be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to stabilize our operations and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the Wholesaler's and Retailer's situations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2243 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about their backlogs and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover my backlog of 9086 units while considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to cover my backlog while aligning with downstream needs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are aligned and can avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 9086 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens our collective profitability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 73 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 14, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 79
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (73 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 468 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 409
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (468 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit is at $-361.50, and I currently have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 73 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can avoid unnecessary fluctuations. This will help stabilize our operations and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and stabilize our operations. My current profit is at $-3526.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 468 units. This situation puts pressure on the entire supply chain, and if we do not act collaboratively, we risk a collapse that will hurt everyone's profits. We must be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to ensure a steady flow and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's align our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, and Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 468 units. This situation threatens our ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is at $-16523.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2243 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. We must be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to stabilize our operations and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about their backlogs and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover my backlog of 9086 units while considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are aligned and can avoid unnecessary fluctuations.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can avoid unnecessary fluctuations. This will help stabilize our operations and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and stabilize our operations. My current profit is at $-3526.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 468 units. This situation puts pressure on the entire supply chain, and if we do not act collaboratively, we risk a collapse that will hurt everyone's profits. We must be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to ensure a steady flow and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.

- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, and Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 468 units. This situation threatens our ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is at $-16523.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2243 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. We must be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. Let's work together to stabilize our operations and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed similar concerns about their backlogs and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover my backlog of 9086 units while considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are aligned and can avoid unnecessary fluctuations.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 9086 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9086]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7232
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (9086 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

External demand (Retailer): 5
Orders received per agent: [5, 0, 0, 0]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 14464]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-478.50. If I cannot fulfill demand, it will impact the entire supply chain. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady flow. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain profitability for all.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current situation is even more critical with 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain profitability for all.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on my backlog and the Retailer's situation to avoid further stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 561 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire supply chain's stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical shortages that threaten our profit trajectories. My current profit is $-20620.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2731 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and oversupply across the supply chain. We must align our strategies to ensure steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to further instability and losses for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on our collective backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to maximize our total profits and maintain supply chain stability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2731 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire supply chain's stability.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mention they have 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units, and the Distributor has 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2731 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical shortages that threaten our profit trajectories, including my own, which is currently at $-73975.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and oversupply across the supply chain. We must align our strategies to ensure steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to further instability and losses for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet the collective backlog while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to maximize our total profits and maintain supply chain stability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11349 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire supply chain's stability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 78 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 6, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 93
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (78 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 561 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 488
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (561 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-478.50. If I cannot fulfill demand, it will impact the entire supply chain. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady flow. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain profitability for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current situation is even more critical with 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain profitability for all.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical shortages that threaten our profit trajectories. My current profit is $-20620.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2731 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and oversupply across the supply chain. We must align our strategies to ensure steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to further instability and losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to maximize our total profits and maintain supply chain stability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mention they have 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units, and the Distributor has 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2731 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical shortages that threaten our profit trajectories, including my own, which is currently at $-73975.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and oversupply across the supply chain. We must align our strategies to ensure steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to further instability and losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to maximize our total profits and maintain supply chain stability.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2731 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 2263
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2731 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-478.50. If I cannot fulfill demand, it will impact the entire supply chain. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady flow. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain profitability for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current situation is even more critical with 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain profitability for all.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical shortages that threaten our profit trajectories. My current profit is $-20620.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2731 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and oversupply across the supply chain. We must align our strategies to ensure steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to further instability and losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to maximize our total profits and maintain supply chain stability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mention they have 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units, and the Distributor has 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2731 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical shortages that threaten our profit trajectories, including my own, which is currently at $-73975.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and oversupply across the supply chain. We must align our strategies to ensure steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to further instability and losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to maximize our total profits and maintain supply chain stability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11349 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11349]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9086
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11349 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-478.50. If I cannot fulfill demand, it will impact the entire supply chain. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady flow. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain profitability for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current situation is even more critical with 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain profitability for all.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical shortages that threaten our profit trajectories. My current profit is $-20620.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2731 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and oversupply across the supply chain. We must align our strategies to ensure steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to further instability and losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to maximize our total profits and maintain supply chain stability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 78 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mention they have 0 inventory and a backlog of 561 units, and the Distributor has 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2731 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing critical shortages that threaten our profit trajectories, including my own, which is currently at $-73975.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and oversupply across the supply chain. We must align our strategies to ensure steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to further instability and losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our backlogs and expected demand to maximize our total profits and maintain supply chain stability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 86 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 5, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 98
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (86 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 3312 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 2751
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (3312 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-607.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 86 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-5356.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 659 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maintain stability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the same concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maintain stability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard Wholesaler and Distributor echo similar concerns about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent further losses and ensure a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-95125.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 14100 units, which significantly impacts our ability to fulfill demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 14100 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14100]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11349
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14100 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-607.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 86 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-5356.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 659 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maintain stability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the same concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maintain stability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard Wholesaler and Distributor echo similar concerns about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent further losses and ensure a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-95125.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 14100 units, which significantly impacts our ability to fulfill demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,

External demand (Retailer): 8
Orders received per agent: [8, 0, 0, 0]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 22698]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-748.50, which is a significant concern. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 94 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs. This situation can lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. Therefore, I urge everyone to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. We need to maintain a steady flow of products to keep our profits stable and avoid a collapse in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while considering the lead time.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts. This will help us minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 94 units, which affects my ability to meet customer demand and impacts the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about their backlog of 94 units and the risk of stock-outs, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a collapse in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the Retailer's situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 764 units, which significantly impacts my ability to meet demand and affects the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about their backlog of 94 units and the risk of stock-outs, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders carefully to prevent a collapse in the supply chain, as my current profit is at $-31574.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 3991 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the lead times and the need for stable supply.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3991 units, which significantly impacts my ability to meet demand and affects the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about their backlog of 94 units and the risk of stock-outs, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their significant backlog of 3991 units and the need for stable supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face critical backlogs that threaten our profits, including my own current profit of $-121300.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order quantities to ensure we meet our backlogs while avoiding excess inventory, which incurs holding costs. We must coordinate to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize the entire supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to cover my backlog while considering the downstream orders and the need for stability.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our production efforts, ensuring we minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17450 units, which significantly impacts my ability to meet demand and affects the entire supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 94 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 105
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (94 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 764 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 679
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (764 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-748.50, which is a significant concern. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 94 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs. This situation can lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. Therefore, I urge everyone to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. We need to maintain a steady flow of products to keep our profits stable and avoid a collapse in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts. This will help us minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about their backlog of 94 units and the risk of stock-outs, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a collapse in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about their backlog of 94 units and the risk of stock-outs, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders carefully to prevent a collapse in the supply chain, as my current profit is at $-31574.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 3991 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about their backlog of 94 units and the risk of stock-outs, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their significant backlog of 3991 units and the need for stable supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face critical backlogs that threaten our profits, including my own current profit of $-121300.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order quantities to ensure we meet our backlogs while avoiding excess inventory, which incurs holding costs. We must coordinate to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize the entire supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our production efforts, ensuring we minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to minimize costs and maximize profits across all stages.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about their backlog of 94 units and the risk of stock-outs, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and further losses. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their significant backlog of 3991 units and the need for stable supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face critical backlogs that threaten our profits, including my own current profit of $-121300.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order quantities to ensure we meet our backlogs while avoiding excess inventory, which incurs holding costs. We must coordinate to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize the entire supply chain.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 17450 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14100
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (17450 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-121300.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (17450 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 103 units. My total profit so far is $-903.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 103 units, which affects our ability to meet customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 879 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-7820.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not align our strategies. I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain profitability and avoid excessive backlog or inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders with the Retailer's demand while managing my backlog.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 103 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 115
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (103 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 879 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 784
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (879 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 103 units. My total profit so far is $-903.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 879 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-7820.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not align our strategies. I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain profitability and avoid excessive backlog or inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about their backlog and the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our current inventory and backlog statuses regularly, as well as our demand forecasts, to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-38737.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 4775 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to market instability and further losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our current inventory, backlog, and demand forecasts regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about their backlog and the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to stabilize the supply chain and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 21461 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-153491.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not coordinate our strategies effectively. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain profitability and avoid excessive backlog or inventory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4775 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 4011
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4775 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 103 units. My total profit so far is $-903.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 879 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-7820.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not align our strategies. I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain profitability and avoid excessive backlog or inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about their backlog and the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our current inventory and backlog statuses regularly, as well as our demand forecasts, to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-38737.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 4775 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to market instability and further losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our current inventory, backlog, and demand forecasts regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about their backlog and the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to stabilize the supply chain and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 21461 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-153491.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not coordinate our strategies effectively. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 21461 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21461]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 17450
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (21461 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 103 units. My total profit so far is $-903.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 879 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-7820.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not align our strategies. I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain profitability and avoid excessive backlog or inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared demand forecasts to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about their backlog and the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and prevent further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our current inventory and backlog statuses regularly, as well as our demand forecasts, to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-38737.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 4775 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to market instability and further losses for all of us.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 109 units. My total profit so far is $-1066.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 112 units this round to cover my backlog and meet expected demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid further issues.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog and expected demand while monitoring the situation closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 109 units, which affects the entire supply chain's ability to meet customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 109 units and emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent further issues in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to help manage my backlog of 991 units and ensure I can meet the Retailer's needs while minimizing my costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to manage my backlog and avoid excess costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 991 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and maintain profitability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 109 units and emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 991 units and the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs that threaten our profits, as I currently have a backlog of 5674 units and a total profit of $-47248.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders to manage backlogs effectively while minimizing costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and excess inventory.

Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their backlog of 5674 units and the risks we all face in terms of profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all in a critical situation with significant backlogs that threaten our profits, including my own total profit of $-192875.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order quantities based on our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our production to meet the collective backlog while minimizing excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 26256 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and maintain profitability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 109 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 112
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (109 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 109 units and emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 991 units and the need for effective coordination. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their backlog of 5674 units and the risks we all face in terms of profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all in a critical situation with significant backlogs that threaten our profits, including my own total profit of $-192875.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order quantities based on our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5674 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 4795
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5674 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 26256 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26256]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 21461
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (26256 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 109 units. My total profit so far is $-1066.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 112 units this round to cover my backlog and meet expected demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid further issues.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 109 units and emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent further issues in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to help manage my backlog of 991 units and ensure I can meet the Retailer's needs while minimizing my costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 109 units and emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 991 units and the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs that threaten our profits, as I currently have a backlog of 5674 units and a total profit of $-47248.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. I can only ship the amount equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow of products.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 109 units and emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 991 units and the need for effective coordination. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their backlog of 5674 units and the risks we all face in terms of profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all in a critical situation with significant backlogs that threaten our profits, including my own total profit of $-192875.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order quantities based on our backlogs and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1233.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 111 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 111 units, which impacts our ability to meet customer demand.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 111 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 6, 2]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 129
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (111 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1120 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 112
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1120 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1233.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 111 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-10987.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1120 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory and to maximize our total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5786 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens my profit trajectory of $-55927.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to avoid excessive backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory and to maximize our total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern. My current profit is $-240800.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 31950 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order schedules to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory and to maximize our total profits.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5786 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 5694
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5786 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-1233.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 111 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-10987.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1120 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory and to maximize our total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5786 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens my profit trajectory of $-55927.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to avoid excessive backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory and to maximize our total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern. My current profit is $-240800.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 31950 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order schedules to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory and to maximize our total profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order schedules to ensure we can fulfill demand without creating excess inventory and to maximize our total profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I am facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left. My total profit is currently at $-1416.00, which is a critical concern for me. I believe that if we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 131 units this round to cover my backlog and meet potential demand, while also emphasizing the need for all of us to communicate our order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 122 units, which is critical for all of us to consider in our planning.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will be ordering to cover my backlog of 6926 units, but I can only ship what is equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 122 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 2, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 131
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (122 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

We must communicate our expected demand and order quantities clearly to optimize our supply chain and avoid a collapse that would hurt all our profits. My current profit is at $-297434.50, and I am concerned that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a further decline in profits for all of us.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1251 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1140
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1251 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 6926 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 5806
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (6926 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I am facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left. My total profit is currently at $-1416.00, which is a critical concern for me. I believe that if we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 131 units this round to cover my backlog and meet potential demand, while also emphasizing the need for all of us to communicate our order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left, emphasizing the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will be ordering to cover my backlog and maintain a buffer to meet potential demand, while also urging everyone to communicate their order quantities clearly.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will be ordering to cover my backlog of 6926 units, but I can only ship what is equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. We must communicate our expected demand and order quantities clearly to optimize our supply chain and avoid a collapse that would hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our production and ordering strategies to prevent further backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog of 37756 units while considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only what is equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. We must communicate our expected demand and order quantities clearly to optimize our supply chain and avoid a collapse that would hurt all our profits. My current profit is at $-297434.50, and I am concerned that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a further decline in profits for all of us.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 37756 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37756]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 31950
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (37756 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I am facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left. My total profit is currently at $-1416.00, which is a critical concern for me. I believe that if we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 131 units this round to cover my backlog and meet potential demand, while also emphasizing the need for all of us to communicate our order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left, emphasizing the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will be ordering to cover my backlog and maintain a buffer to meet potential demand, while also urging everyone to communicate their order quantities clearly.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to prevent further backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will be ordering to cover my backlog of 6926 units, but I can only ship what is equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog. We must communicate our expected demand and order quantities clearly to optimize our supply chain and avoid a collapse that would hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are facing a significant backlog of 122 units and have no inventory left, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our production and ordering strategies to prevent further backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog of 37756 units while considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only what is equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. We must communicate our expected demand and order quantities clearly to optimize our supply chain and avoid a collapse that would hurt all our profits. My current profit is at $-297434.50, and I am concerned that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a further decline in profits for all of us.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent stock-outs or excess inventory across the supply chain.

This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover my backlog while considering the demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 128 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and that they are facing a backlog of 128 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1393 units, which puts significant pressure on my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit trajectory of $-14953.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover my backlog while considering the demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying and to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1393 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and that they are facing a backlog of 128 units. I also hear Wholesaler mention a backlog of 1393 units, which puts significant pressure on their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stockouts, which threatens our profits. My current profit is $-78778.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 8308 units. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. We need to ensure that our orders align to prevent oversupply and stockouts, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and that they are facing a backlog of 128 units. I also hear Wholesaler mention a backlog of 1393 units, and Distributor has a backlog of 8308 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stockouts, which threatens our profits. My current profit is $-364487.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 44702 units. This situation puts immense pressure on my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. We need to ensure that our orders align to prevent oversupply and stockouts, which could lead to further losses for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production to meet the collective backlog while avoiding excess stock.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 128 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [2, 11, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 142
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (128 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1393 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-1608.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 128 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 44702 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 37887
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (44702 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-1608.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 128 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 140 units. My total profit so far is $-1818.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 140 units, which affects the entire chain's stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1541 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-17264.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not align our strategies.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on minimizing backlog costs while ensuring we meet demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1541 units, which affects the entire chain's stability and profitability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about coordinating orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant backlogs and low inventory, which threatens our profits and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on our current backlogs and expected demand to ensure we can meet market needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on placing orders that align with our collective backlogs to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 9721 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and affects the entire chain's stability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 140 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 6, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 148
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (140 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1541 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1413
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1541 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 140 units. My total profit so far is $-1818.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1541 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-17264.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about coordinating orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant backlogs and low inventory, which threatens our profits and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on our current backlogs and expected demand to ensure we can meet market needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain, and the Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities based on our backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant backlogs and low inventory, which threatens our profits and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production schedules and prevent a collapse in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our total profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 9721 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8328
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (9721 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 140 units. My total profit so far is $-1818.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1541 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-17264.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about coordinating orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant backlogs and low inventory, which threatens our profits and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on our current backlogs and expected demand to ensure we can meet market needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain, and the Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities based on our backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant backlogs and low inventory, which threatens our profits and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production schedules and prevent a collapse in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our total profits.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 140 units. My total profit so far is $-1818.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1541 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand. My total profit so far is $-17264.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the potential for market instability if we do not align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about coordinating orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant backlogs and low inventory, which threatens our profits and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on our current backlogs and expected demand to ensure we can meet market needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. The Wholesaler echoed this concern about stabilizing our supply chain, and the Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities based on our backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant backlogs and low inventory, which threatens our profits and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production schedules and prevent a collapse in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our total profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 152 units. My total profit so far is $-2046.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all maximize our profits and prevent stock-outs, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1701 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory of $-19816.00.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address our significant backlogs and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all maximize our profits and prevent stock-outs. My current profit is $-110282.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 11282 units, which severely impacts our ability to meet demand. We need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Let's work together to maintain steady flows and avoid market instability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 152 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 12, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 160
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (152 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1701 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1561
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1701 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11282 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9741
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11282 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 62771 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [62771]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 53030
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (62771 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 152 units. My total profit so far is $-2046.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 162 units. My total profit so far is $-2289.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory. This will help stabilize our profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 162 units, which affects the entire supply chain's ability to meet customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize our profits and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1873 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet customer demand. My total profit so far is $-22625.50, and I am concerned about the risks of stock-outs and the associated backlog costs. I propose that we align our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without excessive backlog or inventory. This will help us all maximize our profits and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on coordinating orders to minimize backlog and holding costs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about coordinating orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our order quantities to prevent excessive backlog and stabilize our profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 13003 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet customer demand and threatens my profit trajectory of $-129787.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without risking stock-outs or oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on coordinating orders to minimize backlog and holding costs while ensuring timely supply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 162 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 12, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 172
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (162 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1873 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1721
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1873 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 162 units. My total profit so far is $-2289.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory. This will help stabilize our profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 74053 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 62771
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (74053 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 169 units. My total profit so far is $-2542.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my backlog and expected demand to stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on my backlog and recent demand trends to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 169 units, which highlights the urgency of our situation.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a steady flow of orders while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, allowing us to align our strategies and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2055 units, which highlights the urgency of our situation and the need for coordinated efforts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14896 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory of $-152131.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply. We need to maintain a steady flow of orders while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Let's work together to avoid a potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on coordinating orders based on our collective backlogs and demand forecasts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, allowing us to align our strategies and minimize fluctuations.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 169 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 10, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 182
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (169 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2055 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1893
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2055 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 169 units. My total profit so far is $-2542.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my backlog and expected demand to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, allowing us to align our strategies and minimize fluctuations.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14896 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory of $-152131.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply. We need to maintain a steady flow of orders while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Let's work together to avoid a potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, allowing us to align our strategies and minimize fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 87076 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory of $-779882.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 14896 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13023
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14896 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 169 units. My total profit so far is $-2542.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my backlog and expected demand to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, allowing us to align our strategies and minimize fluctuations.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14896 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory of $-152131.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply. We need to maintain a steady flow of orders while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Let's work together to avoid a potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, allowing us to align our strategies and minimize fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 87076 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory of $-779882.50.

          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (87076 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 169 units. My total profit so far is $-2542.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will be placing an order that reflects my backlog and expected demand to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, allowing us to align our strategies and minimize fluctuations.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14896 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory of $-152131.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply. We need to maintain a steady flow of orders while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Let's work together to avoid a potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, allowing us to align our strategies and minimize fluctuations.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 87076 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory of $-779882.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and mitigate risks of stockouts and oversupply. We need to maintain a steady flow of orders while being mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.
