Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 99, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=Maintaining inventory buffer to cover expected demand and avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Potential demand fluctuations may result in overstock or stockouts if not managed., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=99, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we all share a common goal of aligning our orders with the expected demand of 20 units next round to maintain a healthy buffer. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units next round while advocating for a collaborative approach to synchronize our forecasts effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a shared platform for real-time updates on inventory and demand forecasts to better coordinate our supply chain efforts.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 2 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that demand fluctuations have been a concern for the Wholesaler. This aligns with my observation of steady demand around 11 units, which has now increased to an expected 20 for the next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to prevent stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to ensure we meet this anticipated demand while keeping my inventory stable.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining a buffer inventory to mitigate demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Update Output: {}
    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 58 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [71]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 38 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 51]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I will order based on expected demand while minimizing holding and backlog costs.",

I also note that the Distributor and Factory emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain committed to our order quantities to meet this expected demand while managing our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to keep my inventory stable and support our collective goal of minimizing stockouts across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we continue to share our demand forecasts regularly to enhance order synchronization and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that maintaining a stable inventory is crucial to support our collective goal of minimizing stockouts. The Distributor and Factory echoed the need for coordinated orders to align with the expected demand of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all maintain our order quantities to match this anticipated demand while being mindful of our inventory levels. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can fulfill the expected demand and keep my inventory balanced.
  Proposal: I propose that we continue to share our demand forecasts regularly to enhance our order synchronization and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining stable inventory levels to prevent stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all keep our order quantities aligned with the expected demand of 20 units to ensure we can effectively meet customer needs. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to support this collective goal while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better synchronize our orders.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining stable inventory is crucial to support our collective goal of minimizing stockouts, and both the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to align with the expected demand of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain committed to our order quantities of 20 units to effectively meet demand while preventing excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units as well to ensure we align our efforts and mitigate any potential stockouts across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for ongoing demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our synchronization efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
