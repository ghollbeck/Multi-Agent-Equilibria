--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-1.00, and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential increases in demand while ensuring I can meet current orders.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to balance between meeting demand and avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as my current profit is $-1.00 and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to balance between meeting demand and avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, ensuring we can adjust our orders accordingly.
  Information Shared: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand while avoiding oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-1.00, and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, we must be cautious of potential stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits. Let's work together to ensure we maintain a stable supply chain and avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, ensuring we can adjust our orders accordingly and maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet expected demand while avoiding oversupply. My current profit is $-1.00, and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, we must be cautious of potential stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand and maintain a buffer against fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce 20 units to balance between meeting demand and avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, ensuring we can adjust our production and orders accordingly to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-1.00, and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential increases in demand while ensuring I can meet current orders.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as my current profit is $-1.00 and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, ensuring we can adjust our orders accordingly.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand while avoiding oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-1.00, and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, we must be cautious of potential stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits. Let's work together to ensure we maintain a stable supply chain and avoid excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, ensuring we can adjust our orders accordingly and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet expected demand while avoiding oversupply. My current profit is $-1.00, and I have 42 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, we must be cautious of potential stock-outs that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand and maintain a buffer against fluctuations.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. My current inventory is 33 units with no backlog, and I have made a profit of $5.00 so far. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our order quantities to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases while ensuring I can meet immediate customer needs.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs while being cautious about overordering.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, and I am planning to order 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will order 20 units from the Distributor to align with the Retailer's needs while ensuring I can meet my own inventory requirements.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balance between fulfilling orders and managing my inventory to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 13 units in inventory and no backlog, and I will order 20 units this round to meet the expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all aiming to prevent stock-outs, my current situation with 0 inventory and a backlog of 7 units means I am unable to fulfill these orders fully. Therefore, I will need to order 20 units from the Factory to cover my backlog and align with the Wholesaler's order, but I must emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid excessive backlog and holding costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on aligning my order with the Wholesaler's needs while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, and I will order 20 units this round to cover my backlog and align with the Wholesaler's order.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Distributor mentioned their backlog of 7 units and the need to order 20 units from me to align with the Wholesaler's order. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. My current situation is that I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which means I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Therefore, I will schedule production of 20 units this round to help fulfill the needs of the Distributor and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, while also being mindful of my profit, which currently stands at $74.00.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on scheduling production to meet immediate demand while managing backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, and I will schedule production of 20 units this round.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 13 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. My current inventory is 33 units with no backlog, and I have made a profit of $5.00 so far. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our order quantities to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases while ensuring I can meet immediate customer needs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will order 20 units from the Distributor to align with the Retailer's needs while ensuring I can meet my own inventory requirements.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all aiming to prevent stock-outs, my current situation with 0 inventory and a backlog of 7 units means I am unable to fulfill these orders fully. Therefore, I will need to order 20 units from the Factory to cover my backlog and align with the Wholesaler's order, but I must emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid excessive backlog and holding costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Distributor mentioned their backlog of 7 units and the need to order 20 units from me to align with the Wholesaler's order. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. My current situation is that I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which means I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Therefore, I will schedule production of 20 units this round to help fulfill the needs of the Distributor and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, while also being mindful of my profit, which currently stands at $74.00.
  Proposal: Let's align our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.

        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. My current inventory is 33 units with no backlog, and I have made a profit of $5.00 so far. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our order quantities to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases while ensuring I can meet immediate customer needs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will order 20 units from the Distributor to align with the Retailer's needs while ensuring I can meet my own inventory requirements.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all aiming to prevent stock-outs, my current situation with 0 inventory and a backlog of 7 units means I am unable to fulfill these orders fully. Therefore, I will need to order 20 units from the Factory to cover my backlog and align with the Wholesaler's order, but I must emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid excessive backlog and holding costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Distributor mentioned their backlog of 7 units and the need to order 20 units from me to align with the Wholesaler's order. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. My current situation is that I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which means I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Therefore, I will schedule production of 20 units this round to help fulfill the needs of the Distributor and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, while also being mindful of my profit, which currently stands at $74.00.
  Proposal: Let's align our expected demand and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize risks of stockouts and excess inventory.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 42]

          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 1. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [8, 42]

        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 31 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $14.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, as my current inventory is only 1 unit and I have no backlog. This puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could impact my profit of $114.50. If we do not manage our orders carefully, we could face stockouts or oversupply, threatening our collective profitability. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $114.50, and I have 1 unit in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stockouts and oversupply, as my current inventory is 0 units and I have a backlog of 39 units. This situation threatens my profit of $55.00 and could lead to a collapse in our supply chain if not addressed. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and maintain a steady flow of supply.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the total backlog and recent demand trends while coordinating with you all.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $55.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 39 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions, and Distributor highlighted the risk of stockouts with their current backlog of 39 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of supply and avoid excess backlog, which threatens my profit of $114.00. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 20 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent any further backlog and maintain stability in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the current backlog and expected demand to balance supply and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which affects our entire supply chain's stability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 31 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, as my current inventory is only 1 unit and I have no backlog. This puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could impact my profit of $114.50. If we do not manage our orders carefully, we could face stockouts or oversupply, threatening our collective profitability. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stockouts and oversupply, as my current inventory is 0 units and I have a backlog of 39 units. This situation threatens my profit of $55.00 and could lead to a collapse in our supply chain if not addressed. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and maintain a steady flow of supply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions, and Distributor highlighted the risk of stockouts with their current backlog of 39 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of supply and avoid excess backlog, which threatens my profit of $114.00. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 20 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent any further backlog and maintain stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 39 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 29, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (39 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 31 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, as my current inventory is only 1 unit and I have no backlog. This puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could impact my profit of $114.50. If we do not manage our orders carefully, we could face stockouts or oversupply, threatening our collective profitability. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stockouts and oversupply, as my current inventory is 0 units and I have a backlog of 39 units. This situation threatens my profit of $55.00 and could lead to a collapse in our supply chain if not addressed. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and maintain a steady flow of supply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions, and Distributor highlighted the risk of stockouts with their current backlog of 39 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of supply and avoid excess backlog, which threatens my profit of $114.00. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 20 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent any further backlog and maintain stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 42, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 31 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, as my current inventory is only 1 unit and I have no backlog. This puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could impact my profit of $114.50. If we do not manage our orders carefully, we could face stockouts or oversupply, threatening our collective profitability. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize the risk of stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to match the true market demand, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid stockouts and oversupply, as my current inventory is 0 units and I have a backlog of 39 units. This situation threatens my profit of $55.00 and could lead to a collapse in our supply chain if not addressed. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and maintain a steady flow of supply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent disruptions, and Distributor highlighted the risk of stockouts with their current backlog of 39 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of supply and avoid excess backlog, which threatens my profit of $114.00. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 20 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent any further backlog and maintain stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to minimize risks and ensure we all remain profitable.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 54 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we are all aligned with the expected demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $2.50, and I have 54 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with expected demand. I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $141.00, I have 27 units in inventory with no backlog, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we are all aligned with the expected demand. I also hear Wholesaler express concerns about potential fluctuations in orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 23 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. My current profit is $125.50, and I am concerned that if we do not align our orders, we could face a supply chain collapse that would hurt all of our profits. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on stabilizing supply while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 23 units, which affects my ability to ship. My profit so far is $125.50.

          - Inventory: 54 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 23 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 20, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [82]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 59
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (23 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 54 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we are all aligned with the expected demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with expected demand. I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we are all aligned with the expected demand. I also hear Wholesaler express concerns about potential fluctuations in orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 23 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. My current profit is $125.50, and I am concerned that if we do not align our orders, we could face a supply chain collapse that would hurt all of our profits. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler express concerns about fluctuations in orders, and Distributor highlighting the risk of not meeting demand due to their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and prevent a collapse that would hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all remain profitable and can meet the expected demand without creating excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 39 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [42, 8, 42]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [81]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (39 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 54 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we are all aligned with the expected demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with expected demand. I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we are all aligned with the expected demand. I also hear Wholesaler express concerns about potential fluctuations in orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 23 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand. My current profit is $125.50, and I am concerned that if we do not align our orders, we could face a supply chain collapse that would hurt all of our profits. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler express concerns about fluctuations in orders, and Distributor highlighting the risk of not meeting demand due to their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and prevent a collapse that would hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all remain profitable and can meet the expected demand without creating excess stock.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 63 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit so far is $-1.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 63 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 4 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. My profit so far is $216.50, and I am concerned that fluctuations in demand could threaten this if we do not align our strategies. I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. This will help us all maintain profitability and prevent potential market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear the Wholesaler expressed concern about fluctuations in demand threatening their profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to ensure a steady flow of supply and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 46 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. My profit so far is $126.50, and I am concerned that if we do not coordinate our orders, we risk market instability and increased costs due to backlog. I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. This will help us all maintain profitability and prevent potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while considering my backlog and inventory constraints.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 46 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler expressed concern about fluctuations in demand threatening profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to ensure a steady flow of supply and prevent market instability. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 62 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. My profit so far is $287.50, but this is at risk if we do not manage our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. This will help us all maintain profitability and prevent potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on current backlog and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 63 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 4 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. This will help us all maintain profitability and prevent potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 62 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 42, 28]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 81
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (62 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($287.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (62 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

External demand (Retailer): 15
Shipments received per agent: [16, 42, 82, 162]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 64 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $4.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our expected demand transparently to align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 21 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but also poses a risk of stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent unnecessary fluctuations and maximize our total profits.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $268.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing expected demand to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent excessive fluctuations in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to meet sudden increases in demand. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and maximize our total profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between order quantities and current inventory to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $328.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also note Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing expected demand to avoid stockouts, and Distributor highlighted the need for alignment to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent excessive fluctuations. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 47 units, which limits my ability to meet demand. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on balancing production to meet demand while managing backlog.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 64 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 11, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [25]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 21 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 11, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [81]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 64 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our expected demand transparently to align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 21 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but also poses a risk of stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent unnecessary fluctuations and maximize our total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing expected demand to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent excessive fluctuations in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to meet sudden increases in demand. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and maximize our total profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also note Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing expected demand to avoid stockouts, and Distributor highlighted the need for alignment to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent excessive fluctuations. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 47 units, which limits my ability to meet demand. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and stabilize the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 31, 25]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [162]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 66
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 64 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our expected demand transparently to align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 21 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but also poses a risk of stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent unnecessary fluctuations and maximize our total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing expected demand to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent excessive fluctuations in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to meet sudden increases in demand. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and maximize our total profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also note Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing expected demand to avoid stockouts, and Distributor highlighted the need for alignment to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent excessive fluctuations. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 47 units, which limits my ability to meet demand. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and stabilize the supply chain.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 64 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our expected demand transparently to align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 21 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but also poses a risk of stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent unnecessary fluctuations and maximize our total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing expected demand to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent excessive fluctuations in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to meet sudden increases in demand. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and maximize our total profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also note Wholesaler emphasized the importance of sharing expected demand to avoid stockouts, and Distributor highlighted the need for alignment to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent excessive fluctuations. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 47 units, which limits my ability to meet demand. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and stabilize the supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 14
Shipments received per agent: [31, 28, 48, 172]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining stability in our supply chain. My current profit is $-1.50, and I have 81 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 81 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 20 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts and ensure profitability for all.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and orders to maintain a steady flow of products and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. To maximize our total supply chain profits, I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect, as it can lead to instability in our supply chain. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid any potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I currently have 51 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet expected demand. However, I am concerned about potential stockouts downstream, especially since Distributor has no inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to balance our supply chain and maintain stability while keeping an eye on future demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce based on expected demand while ensuring we avoid excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our production schedules to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 51 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to support downstream demand effectively.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 20 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 25, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [121]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining stability in our supply chain. My current profit is $-1.50, and I have 81 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 20 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts and ensure profitability for all.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and orders to maintain a steady flow of products and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. To maximize our total supply chain profits, I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect, as it can lead to instability in our supply chain. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid any potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I currently have 51 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet expected demand. However, I am concerned about potential stockouts downstream, especially since Distributor has no inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to balance our supply chain and maintain stability while keeping an eye on future demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our production schedules to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 51 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 81, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 89
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining stability in our supply chain. My current profit is $-1.50, and I have 81 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 20 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts and ensure profitability for all.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and orders to maintain a steady flow of products and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. To maximize our total supply chain profits, I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect, as it can lead to instability in our supply chain. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid any potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of planning our orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I currently have 51 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet expected demand. However, I am concerned about potential stockouts downstream, especially since Distributor has no inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to balance our supply chain and maintain stability while keeping an eye on future demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and adjust our production schedules to ensure we meet customer demand without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning to avoid future stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 14, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-39.50, and I have 101 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 127 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [25, 29, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [64]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 29
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 204 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [81, 49, 35]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 49
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-39.50, and I have 101 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $-83.50, and I have 123 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 123 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 123 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 5, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 103 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 5, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $-83.50, and I have 123 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to maximize profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to maximize profits. I currently have 201 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I must be cautious about future orders to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products, while also being mindful of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for coordination to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products, while also being mindful of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the risk of stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for coordination to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 230 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [49, 35, 47]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 49
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($1022.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (230 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-134.00, and I have 136 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 136 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. I currently have 111 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet expected demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could threaten my profit of $368.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our collective profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $500.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 136 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 111 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-134.00, and I have 136 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. I currently have 111 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet expected demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could threaten my profit of $368.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $500.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 242 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $1081.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 218 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 27, 27]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [72]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-134.00, and I have 136 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. I currently have 111 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet expected demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could threaten my profit of $368.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $500.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 242 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $1081.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-134.00, and I have 136 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. I currently have 111 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet expected demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could threaten my profit of $368.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $500.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a stable supply chain. I currently have 242 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential fluctuations that could threaten my profit of $1081.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.
