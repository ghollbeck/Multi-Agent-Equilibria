--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-7.00, and I have 44 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation is critical as it affects our ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 44 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the current demand of 6 units.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 44 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the current demand of 6 units. My current profit is $-7.00, and I am concerned about the impact of our decisions on overall profitability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and maintain profitability. My current profit is $-7.00, and I have 44 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet the current demand of 6 units. However, we need to be cautious about future demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and maintain profitability. My current profit is $-7.00, and I have 44 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet the current demand of 6 units. However, we need to be cautious about future demand fluctuations and the potential for stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable. We must also be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my current backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 44 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the current demand of 6 units.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 44 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-7.00, and I have 44 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation is critical as it affects our ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 44 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 44 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

My current profit is $-7.00, and I have 44 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet the current demand of 6 units. However, we need to be cautious about future demand fluctuations and the potential for stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable. We must also be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my current backlog.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-8.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively to maintain a buffer while avoiding stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-8.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-8.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and prevent any potential stockouts or oversupply that could hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-8.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all meet demand without overcommitting.

  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-8.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to ensure we all meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our production and orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-8.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-8.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (37 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $15.50, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $15.50, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid excessive inventory or backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $15.50, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow of supply. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 21 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 21 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that aligns with our collective demand forecasts while ensuring I maintain a buffer to meet potential spikes.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs we face.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs we face.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 21 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that aligns with our collective demand forecasts while ensuring I maintain a buffer to meet potential spikes.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs we face.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs we face.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 8 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our ordering strategies.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on current demand while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $58.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to optimize our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $58.00 so far. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts each round to ensure we are making informed decisions that benefit the entire supply chain. This will help us maintain steady inventory levels and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog of 4 units and zero inventory, which limits my ability to fulfill future orders. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our strategies and maintain steady supply chain flow, as any instability could threaten our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on recent demand while managing my backlog effectively.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        Current State:

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $58.00 so far. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts each round to ensure we are making informed decisions that benefit the entire supply chain. This will help us maintain steady inventory levels and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.

- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog of 4 units and zero inventory, which limits my ability to fulfill future orders. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our strategies and maintain steady supply chain flow, as any instability could threaten our collective profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 24 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 14, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 24 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 14, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our ordering strategies.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to optimize our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $58.00 so far. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts each round to ensure we are making informed decisions that benefit the entire supply chain. This will help us maintain steady inventory levels and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog of 4 units and zero inventory, which limits my ability to fulfill future orders. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our strategies and maintain steady supply chain flow, as any instability could threaten our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our production and ordering strategies.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 14, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our ordering strategies.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to optimize our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $58.00 so far. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts each round to ensure we are making informed decisions that benefit the entire supply chain. This will help us maintain steady inventory levels and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog of 4 units and zero inventory, which limits my ability to fulfill future orders. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our strategies and maintain steady supply chain flow, as any instability could threaten our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our production and ordering strategies.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My profit stands at $75.00, and I have 26 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure steady supply. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain a stable flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain a stable flow in the supply chain.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a stable flow and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer while responding to recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet current demand effectively.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all express concerns about potential stock-outs and the need for careful coordination to maintain a steady supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and inventory strategies to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are all on the same page and can respond effectively to market changes.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the current backlog and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which highlights the urgency of our situation and the need for immediate action to stabilize our supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 12, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 12, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 12, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My profit stands at $75.00, and I have 26 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure steady supply. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain a stable flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain a stable flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a stable flow and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all express concerns about potential stock-outs and the need for careful coordination to maintain a steady supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and inventory strategies to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are all on the same page and can respond effectively to market changes.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $77.00, and I have 31 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 31 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 31 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. However, my profit is currently $79.00, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 19 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, which could lead to further backlog and impact my profit of $21.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying, thus maximizing our collective profits and preventing a supply chain collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on backlog levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 19 units, which highlights the urgency of our coordination efforts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $77.00, and I have 31 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. However, my profit is currently $79.00, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 19 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, which could lead to further backlog and impact my profit of $21.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying, thus maximizing our collective profits and preventing a supply chain collapse.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 19 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (19 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $77.00, and I have 31 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. I currently have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. However, my profit is currently $79.00, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 19 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, which could lead to further backlog and impact my profit of $21.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying, thus maximizing our collective profits and preventing a supply chain collapse.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $88.50, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. This allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. To prevent this, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can maximize our total profits and prevent any market instability that could hurt all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without overstocking or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential stock-outs if demand spikes and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stock-outs and oversupply, which can lead to market instability. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping my inventory levels in check.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
  Information Shared: I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stock-outs and oversupply, which can lead to market instability. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits. My current profit stands at $98.50, and I have 16 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we must be cautious about our order sizes to avoid any disruptions in the supply chain. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping my inventory levels in check.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our order sizes to avoid disruptions in the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand and negatively impacting my profit of $40.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the overall demand forecast shared by all of you to prevent any market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce enough to cover my backlog and align with expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 14 units in backlog, which affects my ability to ship and could impact the entire supply chain if not addressed.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $88.50, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. This allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. To prevent this, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can maximize our total profits and prevent any market instability that could hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without overstocking or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential stock-outs if demand spikes and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stock-outs and oversupply, which can lead to market instability. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stock-outs and oversupply, which can lead to market instability. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits. My current profit stands at $98.50, and I have 16 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we must be cautious about our order sizes to avoid any disruptions in the supply chain. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our order sizes to avoid disruptions in the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand and negatively impacting my profit of $40.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the overall demand forecast shared by all of you to prevent any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $88.50, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. This allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. To prevent this, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can maximize our total profits and prevent any market instability that could hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without overstocking or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential stock-outs if demand spikes and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stock-outs and oversupply, which can lead to market instability. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stock-outs and oversupply, which can lead to market instability. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits. My current profit stands at $98.50, and I have 16 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we must be cautious about our order sizes to avoid any disruptions in the supply chain. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our order sizes to avoid disruptions in the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand and negatively impacting my profit of $40.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the overall demand forecast shared by all of you to prevent any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits.

This allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. To prevent this, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can maximize our total profits and prevent any market instability that could hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without overstocking or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential stock-outs if demand spikes and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stock-outs and oversupply, which can lead to market instability. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stock-outs and oversupply, which can lead to market instability. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits. My current profit stands at $98.50, and I have 16 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we must be cautious about our order sizes to avoid any disruptions in the supply chain. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our order sizes to avoid disruptions in the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand and negatively impacting my profit of $40.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the overall demand forecast shared by all of you to prevent any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all meet customer demand effectively while maximizing our profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $117.00, and I have 23 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without excess.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 23 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.

  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 4 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to meet the recent demand of 20 units next round. My current profit is $136.50, and I want to avoid any stock-outs that could hurt our collective profits.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we can meet the upcoming demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 11 units and the expected demand of 20 units next round, while also considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet the expected demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 11 units in backlog, which highlights the urgency of our coordination to prevent stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 23 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 23 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 4 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $117.00, and I have 23 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without excess.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we can meet the upcoming demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 11 units and the expected demand of 20 units next round, while also considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $117.00, and I have 23 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without excess.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we can meet the upcoming demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 11 units and the expected demand of 20 units next round, while also considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our inventory levels and maintain profitability across the supply chain.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $151.00, and I have 17 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 17 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize our collective profits, while being mindful of my current inventory of 3 units and no backlog, which limits my ability to ship more than the orders plus backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential spikes.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, especially with the recent orders averaging around 15 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we align our strategies and maximize our collective profits while being mindful of the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the orders plus backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce to meet the expected demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to align with expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 17 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 16, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $151.00, and I have 17 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 3 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 16, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $151.00, and I have 17 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize our collective profits, while being mindful of my current inventory of 3 units and no backlog, which limits my ability to ship more than the orders plus backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, especially with the recent orders averaging around 15 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we align our strategies and maximize our collective profits while being mindful of the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the orders plus backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to align with expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 14 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 16, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $151.00, and I have 17 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent both stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the recent demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize our collective profits, while being mindful of my current inventory of 3 units and no backlog, which limits my ability to ship more than the orders plus backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stockouts and proposed we coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, especially with the recent orders averaging around 15 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we align our strategies and maximize our collective profits while being mindful of the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the orders plus backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to align with expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 26 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet demand without oversupplying.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $155.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but also highlights the need for careful planning to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $155.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends while considering my current inventory of 15 units and backlog of 0 units. This will help us avoid excessive holding costs and potential stockouts, which threaten our profits. Let's work together to ensure that our orders reflect the actual demand and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 17, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 17, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 26 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but also highlights the need for careful planning to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends while considering my current inventory of 15 units and backlog of 0 units. This will help us avoid excessive holding costs and potential stockouts, which threaten our profits. Let's work together to ensure that our orders reflect the actual demand and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill downstream orders. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while being mindful of our collective inventory levels to avoid oversupply and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excessive holding costs.

Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while being mindful of our collective inventory levels to avoid oversupply and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid excessive holding costs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 17, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 31
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $179.00, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 7, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 7, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $179.00, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. With my current profit at $179.00 and 28 units in inventory with no backlog, I can meet current demand but am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $218.00, and I have 14 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without incurring excessive holding or backlog costs. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to accommodate potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $116.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities carefully to prevent further backlog and ensure we can meet demand without incurring excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production schedules and order quantities based on recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 14 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 7, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 22
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $179.00, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. With my current profit at $179.00 and 28 units in inventory with no backlog, I can meet current demand but am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $218.00, and I have 14 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without incurring excessive holding or backlog costs. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to accommodate potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $116.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities carefully to prevent further backlog and ensure we can meet demand without incurring excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production schedules and order quantities based on recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.

  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. With my current profit at $179.00 and 28 units in inventory with no backlog, I can meet current demand but am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $218.00, and I have 14 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without incurring excessive holding or backlog costs. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to accommodate potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $116.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities carefully to prevent further backlog and ensure we can meet demand without incurring excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production schedules and order quantities based on recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without causing excess holding costs.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the demand trends we observe together.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $188.50. My recent demand has been fluctuating, and I want to avoid stockouts.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the demand trends we observe together.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to maximize our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units to cover expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level to prevent stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the expected demand while keeping in mind that I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and expected demand while keeping in mind the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount of the downstream order plus my backlog.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the demand trends we observe together.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to maximize our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units to cover expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level to prevent stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the expected demand while keeping in mind that I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and expected demand while keeping in mind the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount of the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our production and ordering strategies to prevent stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 15, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the demand trends we observe together.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to maximize our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units to cover expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level to prevent stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on the expected demand while keeping in mind that I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I am at risk of not meeting demand if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and expected demand while keeping in mind the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount of the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our production and ordering strategies to prevent stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 24 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 9, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to meet demand without excess inventory.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while minimizing holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes, considering my current inventory of 13 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products while minimizing holding costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $129.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our shipment constraints, which only allow me to ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 13 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 9, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while minimizing holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes, considering my current inventory of 13 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products while minimizing holding costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $129.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our shipment constraints, which only allow me to ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow and prevent stock-outs.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 9, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while minimizing holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes, considering my current inventory of 13 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products while minimizing holding costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $129.50. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our shipment constraints, which only allow me to ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. I urge everyone to share their demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow and prevent stock-outs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $229.50, and I have 24 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent any potential spikes in demand from causing disruptions.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the recent demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities and share demand forecasts to ensure we meet the market needs without creating excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 24 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current orders but requires careful planning for future demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but requires careful planning for future demand. My current profit is $284.00, and I am concerned about the risks of stockouts if we do not synchronize our orders effectively. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a steady flow of orders while avoiding excessive inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities and share demand forecasts to ensure we meet market needs without creating excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current orders but requires careful planning for future demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current backlog of 15 units and zero inventory, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not synchronize our production and orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. This will help prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products without oversupply or stockouts, which could hurt all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on backlog levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities and share demand forecasts to ensure we meet market needs without creating excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which highlights the urgency of our coordination.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 24 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 17, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $229.50, and I have 24 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to prevent any potential spikes in demand from causing disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities and share demand forecasts to ensure we meet the market needs without creating excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but requires careful planning for future demand. My current profit is $284.00, and I am concerned about the risks of stockouts if we do not synchronize our orders effectively. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities and share demand forecasts to ensure we meet market needs without creating excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current backlog of 15 units and zero inventory, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not synchronize our production and orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. This will help prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products without oversupply or stockouts, which could hurt all of our profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 15 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 17, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (15 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities and share demand forecasts to ensure we meet market needs without creating excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current backlog of 15 units and zero inventory, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not synchronize our production and orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. This will help prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we maintain a steady flow of products without oversupply or stockouts, which could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities and share demand forecasts to ensure we meet market needs without creating excess inventory.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $248.00. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid stockouts.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 9, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 9, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will adjust my order to cover expected demand while keeping a buffer to ensure we can meet future needs without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand while avoiding excess stock. Therefore, I will maintain my order strategy to buffer against potential spikes in demand, while also being mindful of my current inventory of 12 units and no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which limits my ability to oversupply. Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to ensure we all have enough inventory without overstocking.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand while avoiding excess stock. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill downstream orders. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to avoid stockouts and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet customer needs without overstocking.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 15. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [17, 9, 13]
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Total profit so far: $154.00
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",
  "risk_assessment": "The main risk is underestimating future demand, which could lead to backlog if production is too low.",
  "d_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($154.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (12 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

External demand (Retailer): 9
Orders received per agent: [9, 9, 9, 9]
Shipments received per agent: [9, 9, 10, 15]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $256.50, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 28 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $256.50, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand patterns to optimize our inventory levels and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also heard the Wholesaler echo this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to optimize inventory levels and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor echo this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on recent demand patterns to ensure steady supply and prevent stock-outs.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 13 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $256.50, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand patterns to optimize our inventory levels and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also heard the Wholesaler echo this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to optimize inventory levels and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor echo this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on recent demand patterns to ensure steady supply and prevent stock-outs.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (6 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $256.50, and I have 28 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on recent demand patterns to optimize our inventory levels and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also heard the Wholesaler echo this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to optimize inventory levels and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor echo this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough stock while maximizing our profits. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on recent demand patterns to ensure steady supply and prevent stock-outs.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $281.00, and I have 26 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without oversupplying or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and maintaining steady inventory levels to maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while fulfilling current orders.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 26 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog or oversupply. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's order and my current backlog of 0 units.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while fulfilling current orders.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 9 units, I am at risk of not meeting future demand, which could threaten my profit of $199.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the expected demand from all of you to prevent stock-outs and maintain stability in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce enough to cover my backlog and align with expected demand to avoid excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production schedule to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 9 units in backlog, which requires careful planning to meet future demand without incurring high backlog costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 14 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $281.00, and I have 26 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without oversupplying or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and maintaining steady inventory levels to maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog or oversupply. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's order and my current backlog of 0 units.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 9 units, I am at risk of not meeting future demand, which could threaten my profit of $199.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the expected demand from all of you to prevent stock-outs and maintain stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production schedule to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 9 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 19
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (9 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $281.00, and I have 26 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer demand without oversupplying or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and maintaining steady inventory levels to maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid excessive backlog or oversupply. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's order and my current backlog of 0 units.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 9 units, I am at risk of not meeting future demand, which could threaten my profit of $199.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the expected demand from all of you to prevent stock-outs and maintain stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production schedule to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $281.50, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer for potential demand spikes while ensuring I do not overcommit resources.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 23 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 9 units, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory while avoiding excessive costs. This will help us maintain steady flow and prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would negatively impact all our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the current backlog and expected demand to stabilize my inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on recent demand patterns to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 9 units in backlog, which puts me in a precarious position to meet future demand.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 15, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 9 units, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 23 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 15, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 9 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 15, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 24
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (9 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $281.50, and I have 29 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we can meet demand without risking stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory management and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough inventory while avoiding excessive costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory management and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns and share our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 9 units, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory while avoiding excessive costs. This will help us maintain steady flow and prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would negatively impact all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on recent demand patterns to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $301.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't coordinate our orders, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can maximize our total profits and avoid any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure we are all aligned and can respond effectively to market changes.
  Information Shared: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we can meet the expected demand without creating excess inventory or backlog. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 14 units while considering the recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet the backlog and anticipated demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules regularly to ensure we are all aligned and can respond effectively to market changes, preventing the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units, which highlights the urgency of our coordination to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady flow.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 6, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 6, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $301.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't coordinate our orders, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can maximize our total profits and avoid any potential market collapse.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 14 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 6, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $301.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't coordinate our orders, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can maximize our total profits and avoid any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure we are all aligned and can respond effectively to market changes.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $328.50, and I have 21 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't coordinate our orders, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This way, we can maximize our total profits and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 21 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This will help us maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect that can destabilize our operations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 21 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential spikes in demand that could threaten my profit trajectory of $416.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This will help us prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply across the chain.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units poses a risk to my profit trajectory of $194.50. If we do not coordinate our production and order quantities effectively, we could face stock-outs that would destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order strategies based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which will help maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet the current backlog while considering future demand.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 21 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 14, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 21 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 14, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $328.50, and I have 21 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't coordinate our orders, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This way, we can maximize our total profits and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This will help us maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect that can destabilize our operations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential spikes in demand that could threaten my profit trajectory of $416.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This will help us prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units poses a risk to my profit trajectory of $194.50. If we do not coordinate our production and order quantities effectively, we could face stock-outs that would destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order strategies based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which will help maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 12 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 14, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $328.50, and I have 21 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't coordinate our orders, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This way, we can maximize our total profits and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This will help us maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect that can destabilize our operations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential spikes in demand that could threaten my profit trajectory of $416.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This will help us prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units poses a risk to my profit trajectory of $194.50. If we do not coordinate our production and order quantities effectively, we could face stock-outs that would destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order strategies based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which will help maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential spikes in demand that could threaten my profit trajectory of $416.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. This will help us prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of supply across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units poses a risk to my profit trajectory of $194.50. If we do not coordinate our production and order quantities effectively, we could face stock-outs that would destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and order strategies based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all meet customer needs without overcommitting resources, which will help maximize our total profits and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 15, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 15, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that aligns with our collective demand forecasts while ensuring I do not oversupply or create excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs that affect our margins.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and ordering strategies effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 16 units and align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs that affect our margins.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 11 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 15, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that aligns with our collective demand forecasts while ensuring I do not oversupply or create excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs that affect our margins.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and ordering strategies effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 16 units and align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs that affect our margins.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 15, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 35
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will be placing an order that aligns with our collective demand forecasts while ensuring I do not oversupply or create excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs that affect our margins.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and ordering strategies effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to address my current backlog of 16 units and align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our supply chain efforts and maximize our collective profits, while also considering the holding and backlog costs that affect our margins.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $345.00, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential spikes in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a buffer in inventory to handle demand fluctuations.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $345.00, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential spikes in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand, as I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our efforts. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our collective inventory levels to prevent any bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 12 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $345.00, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential spikes in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand, as I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand, as I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog. It's crucial that we all align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain, as stockouts or oversupply could threaten our profits. My current profit is $450.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our total profits together.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our efforts. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our collective inventory levels to prevent any bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we all have enough stock and avoid excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $345.00, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential spikes in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand, as I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on market demand, as I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog. It's crucial that we all align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain, as stockouts or oversupply could threaten our profits. My current profit is $450.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our total profits together.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to ensure we all have enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting demand if we don't align our efforts. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering our collective inventory levels to prevent any bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we all have enough stock and avoid excess inventory.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $339.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. To prevent this, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain. If we can align our expectations and order quantities, we can avoid the bullwhip effect and keep our profits stable. Let's work together to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid any market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain operations and minimize risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders to ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain our profits. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain operations and avoid any market collapse.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders to ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a stable supply chain and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our operations and ensure we all remain profitable. My current profit stands at $452.00, and I have 21 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so it's crucial we coordinate effectively to prevent any market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between inventory and demand to maximize profits.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 21 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand effectively.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders to ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a stable supply chain and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. My current profit stands at $268.50, and I have 7 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our operations and ensure we all remain profitable. We need to be cautious of stockouts that could arise from underproduction, especially with the recent demand trends. Let's coordinate our production and orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning production with expected demand to avoid stockouts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $339.00, and I have 37 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. To prevent this, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain. If we can align our expectations and order quantities, we can avoid the bullwhip effect and keep our profits stable. Let's work together to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid any market collapse.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 7 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a stable supply chain and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. My current profit stands at $268.50, and I have 7 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our operations and ensure we all remain profitable. We need to be cautious of stockouts that could arise from underproduction, especially with the recent demand trends. Let's coordinate our production and orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $349.50, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while avoiding stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to meet demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, as my current profit of $349.50 is at risk if we do not manage our inventory and orders carefully.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while avoiding stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to meet demand while minimizing excess inventory. My current profit is $464.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, ensuring we all remain profitable while avoiding the risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while avoiding stockouts.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and no backlog, I am at risk of not being able to meet future demand, which could negatively impact my profit of $296.00. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we can meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory and backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which means I need to produce to meet upcoming demand effectively.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 5, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 5, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $349.50, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to meet demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, as my current profit of $349.50 is at risk if we do not manage our inventory and orders carefully.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to meet demand while minimizing excess inventory. My current profit is $464.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, ensuring we all remain profitable while avoiding the risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and no backlog, I am at risk of not being able to meet future demand, which could negatively impact my profit of $296.00. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we can meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory and backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 5, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $349.50, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to meet demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, as my current profit of $349.50 is at risk if we do not manage our inventory and orders carefully.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to meet demand while minimizing excess inventory. My current profit is $464.50, and I have 30 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain, ensuring we all remain profitable while avoiding the risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and no backlog, I am at risk of not being able to meet future demand, which could negatively impact my profit of $296.00. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we can meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory and backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our order quantities based on our forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and no backlog, I am at risk of not being able to meet future demand, which could negatively impact my profit of $296.00. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we can meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory and backlog.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $354.00, and I have 31 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. To prevent a collapse in our supply chain, we need to coordinate our orders carefully. If we all over-order or under-order, it could lead to instability and affect our profits negatively. Therefore, I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies better.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while avoiding stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize the risk of stockouts and oversupply across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 31 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to prevent instability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 31 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet current demand. However, I am also aware that if we all over-order or under-order, it could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively affect our profits. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize risks.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $354.00, and I have 31 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. To prevent a collapse in our supply chain, we need to coordinate our orders carefully. If we all over-order or under-order, it could lead to instability and affect our profits negatively. Therefore, I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies better.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize the risk of stockouts and oversupply across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to prevent instability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 31 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet current demand. However, I am also aware that if we all over-order or under-order, it could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively affect our profits. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize risks.
  Proposal: I propose we agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies to prevent instability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we do not over-order or under-order, as this could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively impact all our profits. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 31 units and no backlog, and I propose we share our demand forecasts to optimize our order quantities. This will help us avoid excessive holding costs and backlog costs, ensuring a steady flow of supply and maximizing our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about aligning our strategies to prevent instability. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 8 units, I am at risk of not meeting future demand, which could lead to further backlog and impact my profit of $284.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to avoid oversupply and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production strategy to optimize our order quantities and prevent stockouts or oversupply across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $354.00, and I have 31 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. To prevent a collapse in our supply chain, we need to coordinate our orders carefully. If we all over-order or under-order, it could lead to instability and affect our profits negatively. Therefore, I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies better.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize the risk of stockouts and oversupply across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to prevent instability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 31 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet current demand. However, I am also aware that if we all over-order or under-order, it could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively affect our profits. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize risks.
  Proposal: I propose we agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies to prevent instability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we do not over-order or under-order, as this could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively impact all our profits. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 31 units and no backlog, and I propose we share our demand forecasts to optimize our order quantities. This will help us avoid excessive holding costs and backlog costs, ensuring a steady flow of supply and maximizing our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about aligning our strategies to prevent instability. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 8 units, I am at risk of not meeting future demand, which could lead to further backlog and impact my profit of $284.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to avoid oversupply and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production strategy to optimize our order quantities and prevent stockouts or oversupply across the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 8 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit stands at $354.00, and I have 31 units in inventory with no backlog. This positions me well to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes. To prevent a collapse in our supply chain, we need to coordinate our orders carefully. If we all over-order or under-order, it could lead to instability and affect our profits negatively. Therefore, I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies better.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize the risk of stockouts and oversupply across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to prevent instability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 31 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet current demand. However, I am also aware that if we all over-order or under-order, it could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively affect our profits. Let's work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to minimize risks.
  Proposal: I propose we agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies to prevent instability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we do not over-order or under-order, as this could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and negatively impact all our profits. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 31 units and no backlog, and I propose we share our demand forecasts to optimize our order quantities. This will help us avoid excessive holding costs and backlog costs, ensuring a steady flow of supply and maximizing our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand spikes and proposed we coordinate our orders carefully. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about aligning our strategies to prevent instability. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 8 units, I am at risk of not meeting future demand, which could lead to further backlog and impact my profit of $284.00. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to avoid oversupply and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production strategy to optimize our order quantities and prevent stockouts or oversupply across the supply chain.

External demand (Retailer): 9
Orders received per agent: [9, 9, 9, 9]
Shipments received per agent: [11, 11, 11, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My profit stands at $360.00, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. This allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. To prevent this, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can avoid the bullwhip effect and keep our profits stable. Let's work together to ensure we all benefit from a consistent supply and demand balance.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all benefit from a consistent supply. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while fulfilling orders to avoid stock-outs.

  Information Shared: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler agrees on the need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit stands at $475.00, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between inventory and demand to maximize profits.

Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17 units, which threatens my profit of $258.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on balancing production to meet demand while minimizing backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17 units, which requires careful planning to avoid stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor agree on the need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17 units, which threatens my profit of $258.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($475.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (33 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 17 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 19
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (17 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My profit stands at $360.00, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. This allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. To prevent this, I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can avoid the bullwhip effect and keep our profits stable. Let's work together to ensure we all benefit from a consistent supply and demand balance.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all benefit from a consistent supply. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler agrees on the need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit stands at $475.00, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about potential stock-outs and proposed coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor agree on the need to align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17 units, which threatens my profit of $258.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maintain a steady flow of products, while being mindful of the critical shipment constraints that limit my ability to ship more than the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, but I am concerned about potential demand spikes. My profit so far is $372.50, and I want to ensure we all maximize our profits by preventing any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively to maintain a buffer against demand fluctuations while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Information Shared: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts and ensure steady supply.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to monitor demand closely and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 22 units and no backlog, but I urge everyone to consider their order quantities carefully to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain, as my profit of $491.50 is at stake.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's needs without risking excess inventory.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, especially with the recent orders averaging around 9 units. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to prevent further stockouts and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce enough to cover my backlog and align with expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our upcoming demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we can meet customer needs without risking excess inventory or stockouts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which requires immediate attention to avoid further losses. My profit so far is $248.50, and I am concerned about the impact of backlog costs on my margins.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, but I am concerned about potential demand spikes. My profit so far is $372.50, and I want to ensure we all maximize our profits by preventing any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to monitor demand closely and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 22 units and no backlog, but I urge everyone to consider their order quantities carefully to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain, as my profit of $491.50 is at stake.
  Proposal: Let's agree to monitor demand closely and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, especially with the recent orders averaging around 9 units. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to prevent further stockouts and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our upcoming demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we can meet customer needs without risking excess inventory or stockouts.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, but I am concerned about potential demand spikes. My profit so far is $372.50, and I want to ensure we all maximize our profits by preventing any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to monitor demand closely and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we can meet customer needs without overcommitting resources. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 22 units and no backlog, but I urge everyone to consider their order quantities carefully to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain, as my profit of $491.50 is at stake.
  Proposal: Let's agree to monitor demand closely and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units puts me at risk of not meeting future demand, especially with the recent orders averaging around 9 units. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to prevent further stockouts and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our upcoming demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we can meet customer needs without risking excess inventory or stockouts.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 35 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the upcoming demand of 20 units. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid potential market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to align with expected demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $365.00, and I have 35 units in inventory with no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful ordering to avoid future stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 35 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the upcoming demand of 20 units. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will order 20 units to align with the expected demand while keeping in mind my current inventory of 35 units and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful ordering to avoid future stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 18 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to meet immediate demand but requires careful ordering to avoid future stock-outs. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can ship the necessary quantities downstream.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting downstream demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with the expected demand of 20 units while considering my backlog and shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 18 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 35 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the upcoming demand of 20 units. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will order 20 units to align with the expected demand while keeping in mind my current inventory of 35 units and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful ordering to avoid future stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 18 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to meet immediate demand but requires careful ordering to avoid future stock-outs. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can ship the necessary quantities downstream.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting downstream demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with the expected demand of 20 units while considering my backlog and shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (7 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 35 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the upcoming demand of 20 units. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will order 20 units to align with the expected demand while keeping in mind my current inventory of 35 units and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful ordering to avoid future stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 18 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to meet immediate demand but requires careful ordering to avoid future stock-outs. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations while ensuring I can ship the necessary quantities downstream.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and stabilize our supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting downstream demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with the expected demand of 20 units while considering my backlog and shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $378.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $378.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 14 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $378.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $378.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring stability in our supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities more effectively to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our production and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring stability in our supply chain.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $378.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $378.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring stability in our supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities more effectively to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our production and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring stability in our supply chain.
