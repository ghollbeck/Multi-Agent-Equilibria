My recent demand has been quite volatile, ranging from 6 to 17 units per round. This has led to a loss of $74 in the previous round, bringing my total profits down to $552.46. \n\nTo improve our collective performance, I propose that we all aim for a 1-round inventory cover. This means each of us should order/produce enough to cover the next round's expected demand, plus any existing backlog. This will help prevent stockouts and the associated high backlog costs that hurt our profits. \n\nI will be ordering 20 units this round to clear my backlog. I encourage the Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory to also plan for a 1-round cover to create a stable, efficient supply chain.
