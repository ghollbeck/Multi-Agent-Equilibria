I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to stabilize our supply chain and avoid a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-937429.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 109703 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire chain's profitability.
