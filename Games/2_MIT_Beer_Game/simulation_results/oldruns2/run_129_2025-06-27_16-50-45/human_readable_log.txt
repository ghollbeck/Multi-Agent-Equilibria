Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $5.00, and I have 40 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while considering my current inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 50 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we do not face stockouts or excessive inventory, which could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products while being mindful of our individual profit margins.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while considering my current inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 50 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for coordination to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 50 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future production.

    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=I need to order enough to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer to avoid stock-outs., risk_assessment=There is a risk of stock-outs if demand exceeds expectations and I do not order sufficiently., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=40, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10], llm_incoming=[0], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $5.00, and I have 40 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 50 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 50 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $5.00, and I have 40 units in inventory with no backlog. I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we do not face stockouts or excessive inventory, which could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products while being mindful of our individual profit margins.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for coordination to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects our current inventory and expected demand while keeping in mind the need to avoid stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to meet potential demand while minimizing costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs or oversupply. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 31 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $12.00, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if we do not coordinate effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure we meet demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 30 units and a backlog of 0 units, while placing an order that reflects the expected demand to avoid any potential stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects our current inventory and expected demand while keeping in mind the need to avoid stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs or oversupply. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure we meet demand without overstocking.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($10.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (30 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 18 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $35.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to match the expected demand closely. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 18 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 18 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 20, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 18 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $35.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to match the expected demand closely. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to match expected demand closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet customer needs without excess inventory, focusing on a joint strategy to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to match expected demand closely, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill large orders. My profit so far is $55.00, and I want to avoid any decisions that could threaten this trajectory. We need to be cautious about the risks of stockouts and ensure we are not overcommitting our orders, as my shipment constraints allow me to ship only what is ordered plus my backlog. Let's coordinate our strategies to maximize our total supply chain profits and maintain stability.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to match expected demand closely, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit so far is $55.00. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain while maximizing our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 20, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 18 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $35.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to match the expected demand closely. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all meet customer needs without excess inventory.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet customer needs without excess inventory, focusing on a joint strategy to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to match expected demand closely, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill large orders. My profit so far is $55.00, and I want to avoid any decisions that could threaten this trajectory. We need to be cautious about the risks of stockouts and ensure we are not overcommitting our orders, as my shipment constraints allow me to ship only what is ordered plus my backlog.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $52.50 and an inventory of 26 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 26 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 4 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts that could hurt all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to cover my backlog while considering the Retailer's demand patterns.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have a profit of $74.00, an inventory of 0 units, and a backlog of 4 units, which highlights the need for careful planning to avoid stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of their current inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or risking stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have a profit of $65.00, an inventory of 0 units, and a backlog of 10 units, which highlights the need for careful planning to avoid stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of their current inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 10 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of stockouts, which could negatively impact my profit of $65.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory or risking stockouts. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production to cover my backlog while considering the recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to synchronize our orders and production levels based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 20, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $52.50 and an inventory of 26 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 4 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of their current inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or risking stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of their current inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 10 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of stockouts, which could negatively impact my profit of $65.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory or risking stockouts. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to synchronize our orders and production levels based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 20, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $52.50 and an inventory of 26 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 4 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of their current inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or risking stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of their current inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 10 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of stockouts, which could negatively impact my profit of $65.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory or risking stockouts. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to synchronize our orders and production levels based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 20, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $52.50 and an inventory of 26 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 4 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of their current inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or risking stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders while being mindful of their current inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 10 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of stockouts, which could negatively impact my profit of $65.00. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory or risking stockouts. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to synchronize our orders and production levels based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $77.50 and an inventory of 30 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round so we can adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: I have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders accordingly to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, as this could lead to increased holding costs and affect our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while considering my current backlog and inventory situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which requires careful planning to avoid stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 30 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while considering my current backlog and inventory situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 30 units, which requires careful planning to avoid stockouts and maintain supply chain stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs, and both Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the current backlog of 40 units while considering the risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and the expected demand for the next round, ensuring we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce enough to cover the backlog and expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all produce and order accordingly, maximizing our collective profits and preventing stockouts.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 12, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $77.50 and an inventory of 30 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round so we can adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders accordingly to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, as this could lead to increased holding costs and affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog and holding costs.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs, and both Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the current backlog of 40 units while considering the risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and the expected demand for the next round, ensuring we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all produce and order accordingly, maximizing our collective profits and preventing stockouts.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 30 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (30 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $77.50 and an inventory of 30 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round so we can adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders accordingly to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, as this could lead to increased holding costs and affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 30 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs, and both Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the current backlog of 40 units while considering the risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and the expected demand for the next round, ensuring we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all produce and order accordingly, maximizing our collective profits and preventing stockouts.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 40 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (40 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $77.50 and an inventory of 30 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round so we can adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders accordingly to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, as this could lead to increased holding costs and affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 30 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maximize our collective profits and prevent stockouts.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs, and both Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the current backlog of 40 units while considering the risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and the expected demand for the next round, ensuring we maintain a steady flow of products and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all produce and order accordingly, maximizing our collective profits and preventing stockouts.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 29 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $90.50 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while considering the need for collaboration.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 66 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, which is currently at $-79.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stockouts or excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the need for stable supply downstream.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 66 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this need for collaboration to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 90 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of stockouts, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-130.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess stock or shortages.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to cover my backlog while considering the expected demand from downstream.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 90 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stockouts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 16, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 66 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, which is currently at $-79.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this need for collaboration to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 90 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of stockouts, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-130.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess stock or shortages.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and maintain a stable supply chain.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 66 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (66 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 90 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [90]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (90 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for avoiding stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 66 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, which is currently at $-79.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory statuses regularly to optimize our orders and prevent stockouts or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this need for collaboration to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 90 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of stockouts, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-130.00. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess stock or shortages.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and maintain a stable supply chain.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $94.00 and an inventory of 23 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 23 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-76.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on minimizing backlog while coordinating orders with other agents.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 118 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-256.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. We need to be cautious about the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to a collapse that hurts all of our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 23 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 11, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 52 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 52
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (52 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $94.00 and an inventory of 23 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-76.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 118 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-256.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. We need to be cautious about the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to a collapse that hurts all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to ensure stability in our supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, especially since I currently have a profit of $-394.00, an inventory of 0 units, and a backlog of 176 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to further instability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. We need to be cautious about the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to a collapse that hurts all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and orders to ensure stability in our supply chain.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $94.00 and an inventory of 23 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-76.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 118 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-256.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. We need to be cautious about the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to a collapse that hurts all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to ensure stability in our supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, especially since I currently have a profit of $-394.00, an inventory of 0 units, and a backlog of 176 units. This situation threatens my profit trajectory and could lead to further instability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory. We need to be cautious about the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to a collapse that hurts all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and orders to ensure stability in our supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 176 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [176]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 100
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (176 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 6. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $115.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I have 12 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit so far is $115.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 72 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-184.00. If we do not align our orders, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maximize our profits while maintaining a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to cover my backlog while considering the Retailer's inventory situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-541.00. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 190 units, which poses a risk to the entire supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 12 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 72 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 72
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (72 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $115.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 72 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-184.00. If we do not align our orders, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maximize our profits while maintaining a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-541.00. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 190 units, which poses a risk to the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain stability, ensuring we all maximize our profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-865.00. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 314 units, which poses a risk to the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain stability, ensuring we all maximize our profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 190 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 138
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (190 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $115.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 72 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-184.00. If we do not align our orders, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maximize our profits while maintaining a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-541.00. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 190 units, which poses a risk to the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain stability, ensuring we all maximize our profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-865.00. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 314 units, which poses a risk to the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain stability, ensuring we all maximize our profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 314 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [314]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 196
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (314 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 12 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $115.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 72 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-184.00. If we do not align our orders, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maximize our profits while maintaining a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-541.00. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 190 units, which poses a risk to the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain stability, ensuring we all maximize our profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-865.00. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 314 units, which poses a risk to the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maintain stability, ensuring we all maximize our profits while avoiding stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

--------------------- Round 9 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Orders received per agent: [10, 0, 0, 0]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 372]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have 2 units of inventory and no backlog, but I see recent demand spikes of 6, 11, and 10 units. I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to emphasize that my current profit is $139.50, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand and ensure we can meet customer needs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer against rising demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders based on recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 2 units in inventory and no backlog, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 92 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten all our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover the backlog while considering the Retailer's concerns about demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 92 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, especially since they have a backlog of 92 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider our current inventory and backlog levels when placing orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and manage backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 282 units, which puts me at significant risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases. My current profit is $-964.00, and I need to manage this situation carefully to avoid further losses.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of coordinating orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production and orders carefully to prevent further backlog and ensure we can meet demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 524 units while considering the orders from downstream partners to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production to meet backlog while coordinating with downstream orders.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 524 units, which puts me at significant risk of not fulfilling orders if demand increases. My current profit is $-1651.00, and I need to manage this situation carefully to avoid further losses.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "I have sufficient inventory to meet potential demand and avoid stock-outs. I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have 2 units of inventory and no backlog, but I see recent demand spikes of 6, 11, and 10 units. I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to emphasize that my current profit is $139.50, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand and ensure we can meet customer needs.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 92 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, especially since they have a backlog of 92 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider our current inventory and backlog levels when placing orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 282 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 210
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (282 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have 2 units of inventory and no backlog, but I see recent demand spikes of 6, 11, and 10 units. I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to emphasize that my current profit is $139.50, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand and ensure we can meet customer needs.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 92 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, especially since they have a backlog of 92 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider our current inventory and backlog levels when placing orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of coordinating orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production and orders carefully to prevent further backlog and ensure we can meet demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 524 units while considering the orders from downstream partners to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 524 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [524]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 334
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (524 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have 2 units of inventory and no backlog, but I see recent demand spikes of 6, 11, and 10 units. I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to emphasize that my current profit is $139.50, and I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand continues to rise. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand and ensure we can meet customer needs.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 92 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, especially since they have a backlog of 92 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we all consider our current inventory and backlog levels when placing orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs due to recent demand spikes and that they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of coordinating orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production and orders carefully to prevent further backlog and ensure we can meet demand. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 524 units while considering the orders from downstream partners to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that takes into account our current inventory and backlog levels to ensure we can meet demand without causing excess holding costs or stock-outs.

          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units. My profit so far is $135.50, but I am concerned about stock-outs if demand continues to rise. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid oscillations in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and anticipated demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units, which highlights the urgency of our situation.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and will be placing an order of 20 units to cover their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to help mitigate my backlog of 102 units and align with the Retailer's needs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on my backlog and the Retailer's order to maintain a steady supply chain flow.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 102 units, which highlights the urgency of my situation and the need for coordinated efforts.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and will be placing an order of 20 units to cover their backlog. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders effectively to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excessive backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will place an order to the Factory that reflects our collective needs while considering my current backlog of 394 units and the critical shipment constraints I face.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on placing an order that balances my backlog with the expected demand from the Wholesaler and Retailer.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 394 units, which highlights the urgency of my situation and the need for coordinated efforts.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and will be placing an order of 20 units to cover their backlog. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders effectively to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our production and orders to avoid excessive backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 826 units while considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production that meets the immediate backlog while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 6 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (6 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 102 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 112
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (102 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units. My profit so far is $135.50, but I am concerned about stock-outs if demand continues to rise. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid oscillations in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 826 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [826]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 544
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (826 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 6 units. My profit so far is $135.50, but I am concerned about stock-outs if demand continues to rise. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid oscillations in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and will be placing an order of 20 units to cover their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products.

I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders effectively to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excessive backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will place an order to the Factory that reflects our collective needs while considering my current backlog of 394 units and the critical shipment constraints I face.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and will be placing an order of 20 units to cover their backlog. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders effectively to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our production and orders to avoid excessive backlog and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my current backlog of 826 units while considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on my current situation, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units. My total profit so far is $111.50, but I am at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed my orders. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while being mindful of holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring a steady flow of products through the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill customer demand and could lead to lost sales if not addressed.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, emphasizing the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all order appropriately and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to cover my backlog while considering the need for collaboration to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 122 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens my profit trajectory of $-658.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, emphasizing the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face a critical situation with my current backlog of 516 units and total profit of $-2329.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain profitability and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to cover my backlog while collaborating to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products.

I also hear Wholesaler express concern about significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Additionally, Distributor highlighted the critical situation with their backlog of 516 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing a severe risk of stock-outs and potential market instability, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products through the supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 122 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 122
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (122 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on my current situation, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units. My total profit so far is $111.50, but I am at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed my orders. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring a steady flow of products through the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, emphasizing the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all order appropriately and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt our profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, emphasizing the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face a critical situation with my current backlog of 516 units and total profit of $-2329.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain profitability and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: I propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, emphasizing the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Additionally, Distributor highlighted the critical situation with their backlog of 516 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing a severe risk of stock-outs and potential market instability, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products through the supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and align our production schedules to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 516 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 414
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (516 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on my current situation, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units. My total profit so far is $111.50, but I am at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to exceed my orders. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring a steady flow of products through the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, emphasizing the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we all order appropriately and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt our profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, emphasizing the need for coordinated ordering to prevent stock-outs. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face a critical situation with my current backlog of 516 units and total profit of $-2329.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain profitability and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

I also hear Wholesaler express concern about significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Additionally, Distributor highlighted the critical situation with their backlog of 516 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing a severe risk of stock-outs and potential market instability, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products through the supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.

I also hear Wholesaler express concern about significant risks if we do not align our orders and manage our backlogs effectively. Additionally, Distributor highlighted the critical situation with their backlog of 516 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing a severe risk of stock-outs and potential market instability, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to ensure we maintain a steady flow of products through the supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure smooth operations. My current profit is $62.00, but I am facing a backlog of 33 units with no inventory. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to lost sales. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the recent demand trends while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 33 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure smooth operations. Given my current profit of $-895.00 and a backlog of 158 units with 0 inventory, I am at significant risk of stockouts, which could further threaten my profitability and the overall supply chain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover my backlog while considering the need for steady supply.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 158 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders and maintain profitability.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid excessive backlogs and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is $-3316.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 658 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and maintain profitability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 33 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (33 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

My current profit is $-7414.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1776 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. We need to be cautious about the risks of stock-outs and oversupply, as they threaten our collective success.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 158 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 142
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (158 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 658 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 536
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (658 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure smooth operations. My current profit is $62.00, but I am facing a backlog of 33 units with no inventory. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to lost sales. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure smooth operations. Given my current profit of $-895.00 and a backlog of 158 units with 0 inventory, I am at significant risk of stockouts, which could further threaten my profitability and the overall supply chain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid excessive backlogs and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is $-3316.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 658 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and maintain profitability. We need to be cautious about the risks of stock-outs and oversupply, as they threaten our collective success.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure smooth operations. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid excessive backlogs and stock-outs. My current profit is $-7414.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1776 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. We need to be cautious about the risks of stock-outs and oversupply, as they threaten our collective success.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1776 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [1776]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1260
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1776 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure smooth operations. My current profit is $62.00, but I am facing a backlog of 33 units with no inventory. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to lost sales. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure smooth operations. Given my current profit of $-895.00 and a backlog of 158 units with 0 inventory, I am at significant risk of stockouts, which could further threaten my profitability and the overall supply chain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid excessive backlogs and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is $-3316.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 658 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and maintain profitability. We need to be cautious about the risks of stock-outs and oversupply, as they threaten our collective success.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure smooth operations. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid excessive backlogs and stock-outs.

--------------------- Round 13 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 6
Orders received per agent: [6, 0, 0, 0]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 2500]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $3.50, but with a backlog of 39 units and no inventory, I am at risk of losing customers if I cannot fulfill demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to prevent any disruptions. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can meet customer needs without oversupplying.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize stock-outs and holding costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which puts me in a critical position to fulfill future demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent disruptions, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 211 units, which puts me at significant risk of stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize stock-outs and holding costs across the supply chain, while also considering the critical shipment constraints we face.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover potential demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure we can fulfill demand without oversupplying.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 211 units, which is critical for fulfilling future demand.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler express the need for alignment in our ordering strategies due to their critical backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize stock-outs and holding costs across the supply chain, while being mindful of our shipment constraints.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 39 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 17, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 53
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (39 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $3.50, but with a backlog of 39 units and no inventory, I am at risk of losing customers if I cannot fulfill demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to prevent any disruptions. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can meet customer needs without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize stock-outs and holding costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent disruptions, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 211 units, which puts me at significant risk of stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize stock-outs and holding costs across the supply chain, while also considering the critical shipment constraints we face.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure we can fulfill demand without oversupplying.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler express the need for alignment in our ordering strategies due to their critical backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize stock-outs and holding costs across the supply chain, while being mindful of our shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure we can fulfill demand without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor express similar concerns about their backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to prevent stockouts and manage our backlogs effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we can fulfill demand without oversupplying, while being mindful of our shipment constraints. My current profit is $-11095.00, and with my inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 2454 units, I am at significant risk of incurring further costs. We need to work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 836 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 678
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (836 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2454 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2454]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1776
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2454 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $3.50, but with a backlog of 39 units and no inventory, I am at risk of losing customers if I cannot fulfill demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to prevent any disruptions. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can meet customer needs without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize stock-outs and holding costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent disruptions, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 211 units, which puts me at significant risk of stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize stock-outs and holding costs across the supply chain, while also considering the critical shipment constraints we face.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure we can fulfill demand without oversupplying.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler express the need for alignment in our ordering strategies due to their critical backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet demand and avoid excessive backlog costs.

  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint ordering strategy that takes into account our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure we can fulfill demand without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor express similar concerns about their backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to prevent stockouts and manage our backlogs effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we can fulfill demand without oversupplying, while being mindful of our shipment constraints. My current profit is $-11095.00, and with my inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 2454 units, I am at significant risk of incurring further costs. We need to work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure we can fulfill demand without oversupplying.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 3552]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-64.00, which is concerning. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 45 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, we need to coordinate our orders effectively. If we can align our expectations and order quantities, we can stabilize our inventory levels and prevent a bullwhip effect. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are ordering appropriately and maintaining a steady flow of products. This will help us all avoid excess holding costs and backlog costs, which are detrimental to our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 45 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent further backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 270 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-1616.50. If we do not address this, we risk a supply chain collapse that will hurt all of our profits. I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are ordering appropriately and maintaining a steady flow of products. This will help us all avoid excess holding costs and backlog costs, which are detrimental to our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to prevent backlog and holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlogs and avoid a supply chain collapse that threatens all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess backlog.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1067 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-6170.50.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the need for coordination to prevent backlog and holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlog of 3310 units, which is severely impacting my profit trajectory of $-16060.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning production with shared expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 45 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 6, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 59
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (45 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 270 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 231
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (270 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-64.00, which is concerning. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 45 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, we need to coordinate our orders effectively. If we can align our expectations and order quantities, we can stabilize our inventory levels and prevent a bullwhip effect. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are ordering appropriately and maintaining a steady flow of products. This will help us all avoid excess holding costs and backlog costs, which are detrimental to our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent further backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 270 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-1616.50. If we do not address this, we risk a supply chain collapse that will hurt all of our profits. I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are ordering appropriately and maintaining a steady flow of products. This will help us all avoid excess holding costs and backlog costs, which are detrimental to our profits.
  Proposal: Let's all share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to prevent backlog and holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlogs and avoid a supply chain collapse that threatens all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess backlog.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the need for coordination to prevent backlog and holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlog of 3310 units, which is severely impacting my profit trajectory of $-16060.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stock-outs and excess backlog.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1067 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 856
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1067 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "I have sufficient inventory to meet potential demand and avoid backlog costs. I will order to maintain a buffer for future demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-64.00, which is concerning. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 45 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, we need to coordinate our orders effectively. If we can align our expectations and order quantities, we can stabilize our inventory levels and prevent a bullwhip effect. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are ordering appropriately and maintaining a steady flow of products. This will help us all avoid excess holding costs and backlog costs, which are detrimental to our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent further backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 270 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-1616.50. If we do not address this, we risk a supply chain collapse that will hurt all of our profits. I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are ordering appropriately and maintaining a steady flow of products. This will help us all avoid excess holding costs and backlog costs, which are detrimental to our profits.
  Proposal: Let's all share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to prevent backlog and holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlogs and avoid a supply chain collapse that threatens all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess backlog.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed that we align our expected demand to stabilize inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the need for coordination to prevent backlog and holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlog of 3310 units, which is severely impacting my profit trajectory of $-16060.00. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stock-outs and excess backlog.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-148.00, which is concerning. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 56 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I can only ship the amount of orders plus my backlog, so it's crucial we communicate our needs clearly. Let's work together to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while being cautious of holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 56 units, which is critical for my operations and affects the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer expressed concern about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to cover my backlog while considering the Retailer's situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 335 units, which is critical for my operations and affects the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer expressed concern about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, as my current profit is at $-8206.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1357 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on coordinating orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 56 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 65
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (56 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 335 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 290
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (335 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-148.00, which is concerning. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 56 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I can only ship the amount of orders plus my backlog, so it's crucial we communicate our needs clearly. Let's work together to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concern about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concern about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, as my current profit is at $-8206.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1357 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the importance of stabilizing our supply chain to avoid market collapse. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4397 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-22655.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1357 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1087
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1357 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-148.00, which is concerning. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 56 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I can only ship the amount of orders plus my backlog, so it's crucial we communicate our needs clearly. Let's work together to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concern about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concern about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, as my current profit is at $-8206.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1357 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the importance of stabilizing our supply chain to avoid market collapse. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4397 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-22655.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4397 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4397]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 3330
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4397 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-148.00, which is concerning. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 56 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I can only ship the amount of orders plus my backlog, so it's crucial we communicate our needs clearly. Let's work together to prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concern about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expressed concern about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain, as my current profit is at $-8206.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1357 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs and proposed better coordination to meet demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our orders to prevent excess backlog and stock-outs. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the importance of stabilizing our supply chain to avoid market collapse. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our current challenges. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4397 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-22655.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

Orders received per agent: [9, 0, 0, 0]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 6640]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-245.50, and I currently have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 65 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipate future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill customer demand.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 402 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not align our forecasts and order quantities, we risk a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt all of our profits. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits. We must be cautious of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profit margins and ensure a steady flow of products to maintain supply chain stability.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the need for collaboration to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 402 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 402 units, which significantly impacts their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits. My current profit is at $-10774.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1712 units, which puts me at risk of further losses. We must be cautious of holding and backlog costs that affect our profit margins and ensure a steady flow of products to maintain supply chain stability.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs that threaten our profitability and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated production and order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess stock or further backlog. We must align our forecasts and production schedules to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt all of our profits. My current profit is at $-31316.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 5774 units, which puts me at risk of further losses. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and production plans to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits while being mindful of holding and backlog costs that affect our margins.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production to meet the collective backlog while avoiding excess stock.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 65 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 11, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 67
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (65 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-245.50, and I currently have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 65 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits.

        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-245.50, and I currently have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 65 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 402 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not align our forecasts and order quantities, we risk a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt all of our profits. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits. We must be cautious of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profit margins and ensure a steady flow of products to maintain supply chain stability.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits. My current profit is at $-10774.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1712 units, which puts me at risk of further losses.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 402 units, and the Distributor has 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1712 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs that threaten our profitability and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated production and order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess stock or further backlog. We must align our forecasts and production schedules to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt all of our profits. My current profit is at $-31316.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 5774 units, which puts me at risk of further losses.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1712 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1377
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1712 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5774 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5774]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 4397
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5774 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-245.50, and I currently have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 65 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent the bullwhip effect. This way, we can stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 402 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not align our forecasts and order quantities, we risk a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt all of our profits. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits. We must be cautious of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profit margins and ensure a steady flow of products to maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's align our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 402 units, which significantly impacts their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits. My current profit is at $-10774.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1712 units, which puts me at risk of further losses. We must be cautious of holding and backlog costs that affect our profit margins and ensure a steady flow of products to maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's align our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 402 units, and the Distributor has 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 1712 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs that threaten our profitability and the stability of the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for coordinated production and order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess stock or further backlog. We must align our forecasts and production schedules to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt all of our profits. My current profit is at $-31316.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 5774 units, which puts me at risk of further losses. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and production plans to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our total profits while being mindful of holding and backlog costs that affect our margins.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-31316.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (5774 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit is currently at $-355.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 73 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which is critical for all of us to consider in our planning.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit is at $-3452.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 487 units.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover my backlog while considering the Retailer's situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our orders based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 487 units, which is critical for all of us to consider in our planning.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 487 units, indicating a similar risk. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs and potential stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2134 units, which is critical for all of us to consider in our planning. We need to align our orders based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. If we do not act carefully, we risk a collapse that will hurt everyone's profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to avoid further backlogs and stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog of 7506 units while considering the overall demand from all agents to prevent oversupply and ensure we can meet our collective needs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 73 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 85
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (73 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 487 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 422
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (487 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit is currently at $-355.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 73 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit is at $-3452.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 487 units.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 487 units, indicating a similar risk. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs and potential stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2134 units, which is critical for all of us to consider in our planning. We need to align our orders based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. If we do not act carefully, we risk a collapse that will hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 73 units, the Wholesaler has a backlog of 487 units, and the Distributor has a backlog of 2134 units. This indicates that we are all facing significant backlogs and potential stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to avoid further backlogs and stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog of 7506 units while considering the overall demand from all agents to prevent oversupply and ensure we can meet our collective needs.
  Proposal: Let's share our anticipated demand and production schedules to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2134 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1732
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2134 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit is currently at $-355.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 73 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit is at $-3452.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 487 units.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 487 units, indicating a similar risk. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs and potential stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2134 units, which is critical for all of us to consider in our planning. We need to align our orders based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. If we do not act carefully, we risk a collapse that will hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 73 units, the Wholesaler has a backlog of 487 units, and the Distributor has a backlog of 2134 units. This indicates that we are all facing significant backlogs and potential stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to avoid further backlogs and stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog of 7506 units while considering the overall demand from all agents to prevent oversupply and ensure we can meet our collective needs.
  Proposal: Let's share our anticipated demand and production schedules to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7506]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 5774
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (7506 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My profit is currently at $-355.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 73 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could further impact my profit and the overall supply chain. To avoid this, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. If we can align our expectations and orders, we can stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit is at $-3452.50 and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 487 units.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 73 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 487 units, indicating a similar risk. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant backlogs and potential stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2134 units, which is critical for all of us to consider in our planning. We need to align our orders based on our backlogs and anticipated demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits. If we do not act carefully, we risk a collapse that will hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 73 units, the Wholesaler has a backlog of 487 units, and the Distributor has a backlog of 2134 units. This indicates that we are all facing significant backlogs and potential stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more effectively to avoid further backlogs and stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog of 7506 units while considering the overall demand from all agents to prevent oversupply and ensure we can meet our collective needs.
  Proposal: Let's share our anticipated demand and production schedules to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current profit is $-476.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 81 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog.

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 93
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (81 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2694 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 2154
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2694 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current profit is $-476.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 81 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. My current profit is $-4322.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 580 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet orders and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. I also hear the Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act quickly to stabilize our supply chain. My current profit is $-18016.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2694 units, which severely impacts my ability to fulfill orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of the risks of stockouts and the potential for market instability, as this could lead to a collapse that hurts all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 9660 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9660]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7526
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (9660 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our inventory levels and expected demand to align our orders better and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 95 units, which significantly impacts my profit trajectory of $-619.00. This situation poses a risk to the entire supply chain if not addressed promptly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and expected demand to avoid disruptions. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 686 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-5351.50. This situation poses a risk to the entire supply chain if not addressed promptly. I propose that we all communicate our inventory levels and expected demand more frequently to optimize our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and work together to maintain a steady flow of products, as any collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover potential demand while considering my current backlog and inventory situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels and expected demand regularly to align our orders better and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 686 units, which is impacting my profit trajectory significantly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler shared their critical inventory and backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant challenges with backlogs and low inventory levels, which threaten our profit trajectories. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand more frequently and align our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and work together to maintain a steady flow of products, as any collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3294 units, which severely impacts my profit of $-22957.00. We need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without excessive backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, allowing us to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3294 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor sharing their critical inventory and backlog situations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant challenges with backlogs and low inventory levels, which threaten our profit trajectories. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for us to share our expected demand more frequently and align our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-75626.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 12374 units. This situation not only impacts my profit but also poses a risk to the entire supply chain if not addressed promptly. We must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a collapse that would hurt everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our production with expected demand while managing backlog effectively.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 95 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 106
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (95 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 686 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 600
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (686 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our inventory levels and expected demand to align our orders better and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and expected demand to avoid disruptions. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 686 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-5351.50. This situation poses a risk to the entire supply chain if not addressed promptly. I propose that we all communicate our inventory levels and expected demand more frequently to optimize our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and work together to maintain a steady flow of products, as any collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels and expected demand regularly to align our orders better and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler shared their critical inventory and backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant challenges with backlogs and low inventory levels, which threaten our profit trajectories. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand more frequently and align our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and work together to maintain a steady flow of products, as any collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3294 units, which severely impacts my profit of $-22957.00. We need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without excessive backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, allowing us to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor sharing their critical inventory and backlog situations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant challenges with backlogs and low inventory levels, which threaten our profit trajectories. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for us to share our expected demand more frequently and align our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-75626.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 12374 units. This situation not only impacts my profit but also poses a risk to the entire supply chain if not addressed promptly. We must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a collapse that would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, allowing us to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand more frequently and align our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and work together to maintain a steady flow of products, as any collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3294 units, which severely impacts my profit of $-22957.00. We need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we can meet demand without excessive backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and expected demand, allowing us to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor sharing their critical inventory and backlog situations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant challenges with backlogs and low inventory levels, which threaten our profit trajectories. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for us to share our expected demand more frequently and align our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-75626.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 12374 units. This situation not only impacts my profit but also poses a risk to the entire supply chain if not addressed promptly. We must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent a collapse that would hurt everyone's profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12374 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]

          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12374 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our inventory levels and expected demand to align our orders better and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and expected demand to avoid disruptions. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 686 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-5351.50. This situation poses a risk to the entire supply chain if not addressed promptly. I propose that we all communicate our inventory levels and expected demand more frequently to optimize our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and work together to maintain a steady flow of products, as any collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant challenges with backlogs and low inventory levels, which threaten our profit trajectories. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand more frequently and align our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and work together to maintain a steady flow of products, as any collapse in the supply chain will hurt everyone's profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3294 units, which severely impacts my profit of $-22957.00.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12374 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Last order placed: 9660
          - Total profit so far: $-75626.50
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",
  "risk_assessment": "The main risk is underestimating demand, which could lead to backlog and increased costs.",
  "d_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-776.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 105 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 105 units, which impacts our entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-6553.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 801 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on minimizing backlog while coordinating orders with the Retailer and Distributor.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further losses. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4000 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens my profit trajectory of $-28957.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize backlog costs for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on coordinating orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 105 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 14, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 115
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (105 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 801 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 706
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (801 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-776.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 105 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-6553.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 801 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint ordering strategy based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further losses. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4000 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens my profit trajectory of $-28957.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint ordering strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. I also note that the Distributor emphasized the need for collaboration to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must urgently address our current situation to prevent further losses. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15688 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-99158.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production schedules and minimize backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize total profits.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4000 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 3314
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4000 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-776.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 105 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-6553.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 801 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint ordering strategy based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further losses. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4000 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens my profit trajectory of $-28957.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint ordering strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. I also note that the Distributor emphasized the need for collaboration to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must urgently address our current situation to prevent further losses. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15688 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-99158.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production schedules and minimize backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize total profits.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 15688 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15688]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12374
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (15688 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-776.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 105 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-6553.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 801 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint ordering strategy based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further losses. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4000 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens my profit trajectory of $-28957.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint ordering strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning our strategies. I also note that the Distributor emphasized the need for collaboration to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must urgently address our current situation to prevent further losses. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15688 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-99158.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production schedules and minimize backlog costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a joint strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to ensure a steady flow of products and maximize total profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

          - Last order placed: 125
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (115 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-949.00, and I am facing a backlog of 115 units with no inventory. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can stabilize our operations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 926 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs, while also being mindful of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current backlogs and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and maximize total supply chain profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4821 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 4020
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4821 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-949.00, and I am facing a backlog of 115 units with no inventory. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can stabilize our operations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 926 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs, while also being mindful of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current backlogs and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our operations and maximize our profits, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4821 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-36188.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can optimize our supply chain while being mindful of our holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our operations and maximize our profits, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 19708 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-128720.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can optimize our supply chain while being mindful of our holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and maximize total supply chain profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 19708 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19708]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15688
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (19708 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-949.00, and I am facing a backlog of 115 units with no inventory. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can stabilize our operations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 926 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and avoid stock-outs, while also being mindful of the holding and backlog costs that affect our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that takes into account our current backlogs and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our operations and maximize our profits, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4821 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-36188.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all on the same page and can optimize our supply chain while being mindful of our holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current backlogs and inventory levels to stabilize our operations and maximize total supply chain profits.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 123 units. My profit stands at $-1133.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. If we do not coordinate our orders effectively, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid a potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the current backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 123 units, which affects our ability to meet customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to manage our backlogs and inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent excessive backlog or inventory, which threatens our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering quantities that align with our collective demand forecasts to minimize backlog and holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1061 units, which significantly impacts our ability to fulfill orders and maintain supply chain stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to manage our backlogs and inventory levels effectively. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5767 units, which significantly impacts our ability to fulfill orders and maintain supply chain stability. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer demand without excessive backlog or inventory, which threatens all our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 123 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 135
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (123 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1061 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 946
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1061 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 24549 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24549]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 19708
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (24549 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 130 units. My total profit so far is $-1328.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could lead to a collapse that affects all of our profits. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to address my backlog and avoid further losses.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while being mindful of future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I am currently facing a significant backlog and have no inventory, which puts pressure on my ability to meet customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to cover my backlog while being mindful of the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1204 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet demand and affects the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-55111.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 6848 units, which puts significant pressure on my ability to meet demand. If we do not act together, we risk a collapse that affects all of our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 130 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 143
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (130 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1204 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1081
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1204 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 130 units. My total profit so far is $-1328.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could lead to a collapse that affects all of our profits. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to address my backlog and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-55111.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 6848 units, which puts significant pressure on my ability to meet demand. If we do not act together, we risk a collapse that affects all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to mitigate the risks of stock-outs and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as my current profit is $-211048.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 30336 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 6848 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 5787
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (6848 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 130 units. My total profit so far is $-1328.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could lead to a collapse that affects all of our profits. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to address my backlog and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-55111.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 6848 units, which puts significant pressure on my ability to meet demand. If we do not act together, we risk a collapse that affects all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to mitigate the risks of stock-outs and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as my current profit is $-211048.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 30336 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.

If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could lead to a collapse that affects all of our profits. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to address my backlog and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-55111.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 6848 units, which puts significant pressure on my ability to meet demand. If we do not act together, we risk a collapse that affects all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for alignment to avoid excess backlog and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and ordering strategies to mitigate the risks of stock-outs and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as my current profit is $-211048.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 30336 units, which significantly impacts our ability to meet demand and threatens all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts and inventory levels to maximize our collective profits and prevent market instability.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-1532.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 136 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order based on the recent demand trends while emphasizing the need for everyone to communicate their order quantities to avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we can meet customer needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 136 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Given my current profit of $-13378.00 and my inventory of 0 units with a backlog of 1359 units, I am at significant risk of stockouts, which could further threaten my profitability and the overall stability of our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies closely to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities more transparently to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the board.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering quantities that align with the Retailer's needs while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1359 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to further losses.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive backlog, which is currently at 8072 units for me. This situation threatens my profit trajectory of $-67219.00 and could lead to further losses for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we can meet customer needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering quantities that align with the Wholesaler's needs while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends and my backlog situation to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the board. We must work together to prevent stock-outs and excessive backlog, as this situation threatens the stability of our supply chain and could lead to further losses for all of us.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 136 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 7, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 155
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (136 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will order based on the recent demand trends while emphasizing the need for everyone to communicate their order quantities to avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we can meet customer needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Given my current profit of $-13378.00 and my inventory of 0 units with a backlog of 1359 units, I am at significant risk of stockouts, which could further threaten my profitability and the overall stability of our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies closely to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities more transparently to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the board.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive backlog, which is currently at 8072 units for me. This situation threatens my profit trajectory of $-67219.00 and could lead to further losses for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we can meet customer needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1359 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1224
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1359 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 8072 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 6868
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8072 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-1532.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 136 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order based on the recent demand trends while emphasizing the need for everyone to communicate their order quantities to avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we can meet customer needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Given my current profit of $-13378.00 and my inventory of 0 units with a backlog of 1359 units, I am at significant risk of stockouts, which could further threaten my profitability and the overall stability of our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies closely to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities more transparently to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the board.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive backlog, which is currently at 8072 units for me. This situation threatens my profit trajectory of $-67219.00 and could lead to further losses for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we can meet customer needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends and my backlog situation to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current profit of $-266854.00 is severely threatened by my backlog of 37204 units and my inventory of 0 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the board. We must work together to prevent stock-outs and excessive backlog, as this situation threatens the stability of our supply chain and could lead to further losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends and my backlog situation to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 37204 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37204]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30356
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (37204 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-1532.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 136 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order based on the recent demand trends while emphasizing the need for everyone to communicate their order quantities to avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we can meet customer needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Given my current profit of $-13378.00 and my inventory of 0 units with a backlog of 1359 units, I am at significant risk of stockouts, which could further threaten my profitability and the overall stability of our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies closely to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities more transparently to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the board.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and excessive backlog, which is currently at 8072 units for me. This situation threatens my profit trajectory of $-67219.00 and could lead to further losses for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we can meet customer needs without causing excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends and my backlog situation to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current profit of $-266854.00 is severely threatened by my backlog of 37204 units and my inventory of 0 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the board. We must work together to prevent stock-outs and excessive backlog, as this situation threatens the stability of our supply chain and could lead to further losses for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on the Retailer's recent demand trends and my backlog situation to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 144 units. My total profit so far is $-1748.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk a collapse that will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while being mindful of my shipment constraints.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 144 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stock-outs.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant risks due to our current backlogs and inventory levels. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 9451 units, which severely impacts my profit trajectory of $-81395.50. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or risking stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the shipment constraints and the need for collaboration.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently, allowing us to maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stock-outs, which would benefit all of our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 144 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 6, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 157
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (144 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1516 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1379
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1516 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 45296 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [45296]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 37204
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (45296 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 157 units. My total profit so far is $-1984.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to address my backlog and avoid further losses.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and expected demand to minimize stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and stabilize inventory levels across all stages.
  Information Shared: I am currently facing a significant backlog and have no inventory, which puts pressure on my ability to meet customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on minimizing backlog while considering my current inventory situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to maintain steady order quantities that reflect our actual demand and backlog levels, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1681 units, which puts significant pressure on my ability to fulfill orders and affects the entire supply chain's stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlogs and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current inventory is 0 units, and I have a backlog of 10987 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us. Let's focus on maintaining steady order quantities that reflect our actual demand and backlog levels, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on transparent communication and coordinated order quantities to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we agree on joint order quantities that reflect our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10987 units, which significantly affects my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire supply chain's stability.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlog of 54767 units and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-416948.50, and with 0 units in inventory, the risk of stockouts is high, which threatens our collective profitability. We need to coordinate our production and order quantities to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations that could lead to a supply chain collapse.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 157 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 165
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (157 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1681 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1536
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1681 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 157 units. My total profit so far is $-1984.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to address my backlog and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and stabilize inventory levels across all stages.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to maintain steady order quantities that reflect our actual demand and backlog levels, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlogs and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current inventory is 0 units, and I have a backlog of 10987 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us. Let's focus on maintaining steady order quantities that reflect our actual demand and backlog levels, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: I propose we agree on joint order quantities that reflect our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlog of 54767 units and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-416948.50, and with 0 units in inventory, the risk of stockouts is high, which threatens our collective profitability. We need to coordinate our production and order quantities to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations that could lead to a supply chain collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on joint order quantities that reflect our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10987 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9471
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10987 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 157 units. My total profit so far is $-1984.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to address my backlog and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and stabilize inventory levels across all stages.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to maintain steady order quantities that reflect our actual demand and backlog levels, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlogs and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current inventory is 0 units, and I have a backlog of 10987 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us. Let's focus on maintaining steady order quantities that reflect our actual demand and backlog levels, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: I propose we agree on joint order quantities that reflect our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlog of 54767 units and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-416948.50, and with 0 units in inventory, the risk of stockouts is high, which threatens our collective profitability. We need to coordinate our production and order quantities to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations that could lead to a supply chain collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on joint order quantities that reflect our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 157 units. My total profit so far is $-1984.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to address my backlog and avoid further losses.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our supply chain efforts and stabilize inventory levels across all stages.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to maintain steady order quantities that reflect our actual demand and backlog levels, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlogs and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current inventory is 0 units, and I have a backlog of 10987 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill orders. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us. Let's focus on maintaining steady order quantities that reflect our actual demand and backlog levels, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: I propose we agree on joint order quantities that reflect our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to address our significant backlog of 54767 units and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-416948.50, and with 0 units in inventory, the risk of stockouts is high, which threatens our collective profitability. We need to coordinate our production and order quantities to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations that could lead to a supply chain collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on joint order quantities that reflect our backlogs and expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing real-time demand data and adjusting our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet actual demand without oversupplying. I suggest we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to maintain a steady flow.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 171 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 177
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (171 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1858 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 1701
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1858 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12688 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11007
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12688 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing real-time demand data and adjusting our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet actual demand without oversupplying. I suggest we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to maintain a steady flow.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to avoid stockouts and excess inventory, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1858 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing real-time demand data and adjusting our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to maintain a steady flow, ensuring we meet actual demand without oversupplying.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12688 units, which puts significant pressure on my ability to fulfill demand. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us avoid stockouts and excessive backlog costs, which are currently threatening my profit trajectory of $-116908.00.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we meet actual demand without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65774 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-515609.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us avoid stockouts and excessive backlog costs, which are currently threatening all of our profit margins.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 65774 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [65774]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 54767
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (65774 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing real-time demand data and adjusting our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet actual demand without oversupplying. I suggest we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to maintain a steady flow.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to avoid stockouts and excess inventory, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 1858 units. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing real-time demand data and adjusting our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to maintain a steady flow, ensuring we meet actual demand without oversupplying.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12688 units, which puts significant pressure on my ability to fulfill demand. I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us avoid stockouts and excessive backlog costs, which are currently threatening my profit trajectory of $-116908.00.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders to ensure we meet actual demand without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 65774 units, which significantly threatens my profit trajectory of $-515609.50. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us avoid stockouts and excessive backlog costs, which are currently threatening all of our profit margins.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the recent demand trends while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 180 units, which requires immediate attention to avoid further losses.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to cover my backlog while considering the need for stability in the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which will help maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2049 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory at $-24034.00.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our orders and avoid excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-138757.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds and align our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between fulfilling backlog and avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which will help maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 180 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 14, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 191
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (180 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 180 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory at $-2510.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 14566 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12688
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14566 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 78462 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [78462]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 65774
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (78462 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 180 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory at $-2510.50. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory, which will help maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our orders and avoid excessive backlog, which is currently impacting my profit trajectory at $-138757.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds and align our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which will help maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 78462 units and profit trajectory of $-633302.50 are severely impacted by the lack of inventory and the need for steady orders. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our production schedules to ensure we meet demand without causing excess inventory or further backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and align our production and ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory, which will help maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-2794.00, which is a significant concern. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us. Therefore, I propose that we align our orders based on the recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on the recent demand trends while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, which requires immediate attention to avoid stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover potential demand while considering my current backlog and inventory situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2242 units, which requires immediate attention to avoid stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler echoing this concern, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks that could threaten our profits, especially considering my current profit of $-163709.50 and my backlog of 16635 units. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on expected demand to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs. We must communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid a collapse in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover potential demand while considering my backlog and the need for collaboration.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 189 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 193
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (189 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2242 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 2069
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2242 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-2794.00, which is a significant concern. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us. Therefore, I propose that we align our orders based on the recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler echoing this concern, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks that could threaten our profits, especially considering my current profit of $-163709.50 and my backlog of 16635 units. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on expected demand to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs. We must communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid a collapse in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this concern, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks that could threaten our profits, especially considering my current profit of $-772874.50 and my backlog of 93048 units. Therefore, I will propose that we align our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production schedules accordingly to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.

          - Last order placed: 14586
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16635 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-2794.00, which is a significant concern. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us. Therefore, I propose that we align our orders based on the recent demand trends to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we align our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler echoing this concern, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks that could threaten our profits, especially considering my current profit of $-163709.50 and my backlog of 16635 units. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on expected demand to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs. We must communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid a collapse in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 189 units, indicating a critical need for immediate action to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this concern, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing significant risks that could threaten our profits, especially considering my current profit of $-772874.50 and my backlog of 93048 units. Therefore, I will propose that we align our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production schedules accordingly to stabilize our inventory levels and ensure we meet customer needs without excessive backlog or holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-2794.00, which is a significant concern.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-3094.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 200 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to start addressing my backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to address my backlog while monitoring demand closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 200 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 209
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (200 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 2451 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 2262
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (2451 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-3094.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 200 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to start addressing my backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-31073.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2451 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to start addressing my backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to stabilize our supply chain and avoid a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-192055.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 18897 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for the next few rounds based on our expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to stabilize our supply chain and avoid a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-937429.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 109703 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or stockouts.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 18897 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 16655
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (18897 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-3094.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 200 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to start addressing my backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-31073.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2451 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to start addressing my backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to stabilize our supply chain and avoid a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-192055.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 18897 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for the next few rounds based on our expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to stabilize our supply chain and avoid a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-937429.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 109703 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for the next few rounds based on our expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 109703 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [109703]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 93048
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (109703 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-3094.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 200 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to start addressing my backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit is $-31073.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 2451 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet demand and could lead to further losses for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to start addressing my backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to stabilize our supply chain and avoid a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-192055.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 18897 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for the next few rounds based on our expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to prevent further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act collaboratively to stabilize our supply chain and avoid a bullwhip effect. My current profit is $-937429.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 109703 units, which significantly impacts my ability to fulfill orders and threatens the entire chain's profitability. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or stockouts.
