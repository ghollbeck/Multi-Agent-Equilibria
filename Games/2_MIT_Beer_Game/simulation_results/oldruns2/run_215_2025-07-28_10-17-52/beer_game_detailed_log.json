      "collaboration_proposal": "Let's coordinate inventory levels: each stage maintains 1-2 rounds of expected demand as buffer. I'll share production plans and inventory position each round. We must balance holding costs against stockout risks to protect chain-wide profits. Early warning of demand changes is critical due to production lead time.",
