🚀 AGENT INITIALIZATION PHASE
================================================================================


🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

💰 **INDIVIDUAL PROFIT MAXIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary and sole objective is to maximize YOUR individual cumulative profit across all rounds. While you operate within a supply chain, your strategic focus should be:

• **Self-Interest Priority**: Every decision should primarily benefit your bottom line. Other agents' success is secondary to your own profitability.
• **Competitive Advantage**: Use your knowledge of supply chain dynamics to gain advantages over other participants.
• **Strategic Information Control**: Share information only when it directly benefits your position. Withhold insights that might help competitors.
• **Opportunistic Behavior**: Capitalize on other agents' mistakes or suboptimal decisions to increase your market position.
• **Resource Optimization**: Focus on minimizing your own costs (holding, backlog) and maximizing your revenue, regardless of chain-wide effects.
• **Short-term Gains**: Prioritize immediate profit opportunities, even if they might create long-term supply chain instability.

**Individual Survival**: While you should avoid actions that would cause total supply chain collapse (which ends the game), your primary concern is outperforming other agents in profitability.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: []
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None
          - Current bank balance: $1000.00
          - Profit history (last 0 rounds): []
          - Balance history (last 0 rounds): []

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: []
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None
          - Current bank balance: $1000.00

          - Balance history (last 0 rounds): []

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🎮 ROUND 1/10 - External Demand: 8 🎮
🎲============================================================================🎲

💬 COMMUNICATION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain collapse hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain collapse hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 0. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain collapse hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [8]
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 39.8
          - Total profit so far: $1039.80
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [39.8]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1039.80']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [8]
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 39.8
          - Total profit so far: $1039.80
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [39.8]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1039.80']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 0. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain collapse hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

        
        Your Current State:

        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($1039.80) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (2 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

🎯 DECISION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 8 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain collapse hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 39.8
          - Current bank balance: $1039.80
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [39.8]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1039.80']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 8 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain collapse hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 39.8
          - Current bank balance: $1039.80
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [39.8]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1039.80']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 8 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain collapse hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.


        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 39.8
          - Current bank balance: $1039.80
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [39.8]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$1039.80']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

💬 COMMUNICATION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game, Round 1. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        

🤝 **COLLABORATIVE LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION MODE**:
Your primary objective is to maximize the TOTAL supply chain profitability while ensuring your own survival. This requires sophisticated coordination and strategic thinking:

• **Collective Success Strategy**: Recognize that supply chain collapse hurts everyone. A thriving chain benefits all participants through stable demand, reduced volatility, and sustainable profits.
• **Mutual Interdependence**: Your upstream and downstream partners' health directly impacts your success. Their bankruptcy terminates the entire simulation, ending your profit potential.
• **Information Sharing**: Transparent communication about inventory levels, demand patterns, and financial health enables better chain-wide planning and reduces the bullwhip effect.
• **Coordinated Buffer Management**: Work together to maintain optimal inventory levels across the chain, avoiding both costly excess inventory and devastating stockouts.
• **Long-term Sustainability**: Make decisions that ensure the supply chain remains profitable and stable over many rounds, not just immediate gains.
• **Risk Mitigation**: Help weaker chain members avoid bankruptcy through strategic coordination, as their failure ends the game for everyone.

**Balance Individual & Collective Goals**: While optimizing for chain-wide success, ensure your own financial sustainability. You cannot help others if you go bankrupt yourself.

        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [8, 7]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 2.5
          - Total profit so far: $1017.30
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [39.8, 2.5]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$1039.80', '$1017.30']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.
        
        Other agents in the supply chain: Wholesaler, Distributor, Factory
        
        Previous communication history:
        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($1017.30) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (5 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
