--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand of 12 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I will be ordering 20 units to maintain stock levels. Therefore, I encourage everyone to communicate their expected demand to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining stock while anticipating demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 98 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units to maintain stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I can meet potential demand while maintaining my inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining stock while anticipating demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on observed demand to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 98 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units to maintain stock levels, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all anticipating similar demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units to align with our collective expectations while ensuring I maintain a buffer in my inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on aligning my orders with observed demand while managing my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue to share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and minimize excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 98 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units to maintain stock levels, and Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all anticipating similar demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units to align with our collective expectations while ensuring I maintain a buffer in my inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on aligning my orders with observed demand while managing my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue to share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and minimize excess inventory.

    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=To cover expected demand and maintain a buffer, I will order 20 units., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could lead to excess inventory or backlog if not managed., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=98, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[12], llm_incoming=[12], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable inventory and no backlog, I will order to maintain stock while anticipating demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential fluctuations in demand could lead to excess inventory or backlog if not managed carefully.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 12 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I will be ordering 20 units to maintain stock levels. Therefore, I encourage everyone to communicate their expected demand to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that the recent demand from the Retailer is 12 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should be prepared for. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts and overstock situations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand from the Retailer is 12 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should be prepared for. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory, which can lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand and suggest that we all communicate our order quantities more frequently to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."

        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 12 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I will be ordering 20 units to maintain stock levels. Therefore, I encourage everyone to communicate their expected demand to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that the recent demand from the Retailer is 12 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should be prepared for. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts and overstock situations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand from the Retailer is 12 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should be prepared for. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory, which can lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand and suggest that we all communicate our order quantities more frequently to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 12 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I will be ordering 20 units to maintain stock levels. Therefore, I encourage everyone to communicate their expected demand to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that the recent demand from the Retailer is 12 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should be prepared for. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts and overstock situations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand from the Retailer is 12 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand that we should be prepared for. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory, which can lead to higher holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand and suggest that we all communicate our order quantities more frequently to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--------------------- Round 2 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 and 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 20 units to ensure we meet anticipated demand while keeping my inventory stable.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balance between inventory and anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 108 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they will maintain their order at 20 units to ensure we meet anticipated demand while keeping their inventory stable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain stock while anticipating potential demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining stock levels while being responsive to demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 80 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they will maintain their order at 20 units to ensure we meet anticipated demand while keeping their inventory stable. I also hear Wholesaler concluded that we should align our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the anticipated demand and minimize fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a balance while considering the recent demand trends.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on aligning my order with the anticipated demand to avoid excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 60 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they will maintain their order at 20 units to ensure we meet anticipated demand while keeping their inventory stable. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, aiming to align their orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering given the recent demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer while being mindful of our collective inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balance between inventory and anticipated demand while avoiding excess costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and optimize our supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently while adhering to shipment constraints.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 108 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 7.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 and 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand is fluctuating significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order strategy to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a significant spike in orders. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential future spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 51.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 and 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand is fluctuating significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order strategy to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a significant spike in orders. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential future spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 48]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 51.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 and 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand is fluctuating significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order strategy to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a significant spike in orders. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential future spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 to 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the average demand observed while maintaining a buffer for fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 115 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our expected demand to align our orders effectively. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain stock while anticipating potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 71 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. I also note that Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to maintain stock while anticipating potential demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a balance between fulfilling demand and managing inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on observed demand while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and reduce excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 47 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 115 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -16.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable inventory and no backlog, I will order to maintain stock while anticipating demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential fluctuations in demand could lead to excess inventory or backlog if not managed carefully.",

  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 to 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to upcoming events. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the coming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with orders ranging from 12 to 28 units. This variability can lead to challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will be cautious in my ordering to avoid overstocking while ensuring we meet demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for fluctuating orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while being mindful of holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain responses and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 47 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 28, 21]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 26.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 to 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to upcoming events. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the coming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with orders ranging from 12 to 28 units. This variability can lead to challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will be cautious in my ordering to avoid overstocking while ensuring we meet demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for fluctuating orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while being mindful of holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain responses and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 8 to 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to upcoming events. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the coming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with orders ranging from 12 to 28 units. This variability can lead to challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will be cautious in my ordering to avoid overstocking while ensuring we meet demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for fluctuating orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while being mindful of holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain responses and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--------------------- Round 4 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [28, 48, 68, 78]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 8-9 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we meet demand without overcommitting.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 146 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they are maintaining their order quantity to meet demand without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to align with the observed demand patterns. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while ensuring I do not overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 83 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they are maintaining their order quantity to meet demand without overcommitting, and Wholesaler mentioned adjusting their order to better match expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while covering potential demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping a safety stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 83 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they are maintaining their order quantity to meet demand without overcommitting, and Wholesaler mentioned adjusting their order to better match expected demand. Distributor also noted the need for alignment to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all coordinate our orders to effectively manage our inventory levels and meet demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while covering potential demand, considering my current inventory of 57 units and no backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping a safety stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 57 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 146 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -18.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around 8 to 9 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units to ensure we can meet any upcoming demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 21 and 28 units. This variability suggests we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 33 and 48 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders accordingly to avoid backlogs. I hear that the Distributor mentioned the need for better coordination to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about our expected demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while ensuring I do not overstock.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 68.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 8-9 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around 8 to 9 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units to ensure we can meet any upcoming demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 21 and 28 units. This variability suggests we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 33 and 48 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders accordingly to avoid backlogs. I hear that the Distributor mentioned the need for better coordination to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about our expected demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while ensuring I do not overstock.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 57 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [48, 33, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 80.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 8-9 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around 8 to 9 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units to ensure we can meet any upcoming demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 21 and 28 units. This variability suggests we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 33 and 48 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders accordingly to avoid backlogs. I hear that the Distributor mentioned the need for better coordination to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about our expected demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while ensuring I do not overstock.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Shipments received per agent: [21, 33, 53, 63]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 9 to 7 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends to optimize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 162 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 9 to 7 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock to fulfill any potential increases in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on a conservative estimate of demand to avoid overstocking.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 9 to 7 units, and Wholesaler echoed the need to be cautious with orders to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to reflect the recent demand patterns to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will adjust my order to cover the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to align with observed demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and reduce excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 123 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand trend with orders decreasing from 9 to 7 units. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need to be cautious with orders to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to reflect the recent demand patterns to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will adjust my order to maintain a buffer while being mindful of the recent demand trends.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to align with observed demand trends while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to better coordinate our orders and reduce excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 75 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently within shipment constraints.

    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=To maintain inventory and cover expected demand, I will order 20 units., risk_assessment=Demand may continue to decline, leading to excess inventory if not managed., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=162, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 8, 7], llm_incoming=[17], llm_last_order=10
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 162 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -34.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable inventory and no backlog, I will order to maintain stock while anticipating demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential fluctuations in demand could lead to excess inventory or backlog if not managed carefully.",

  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 9, 8, 7. This suggests a potential decline in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 9, 8, 7. This suggests a potential decline in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to avoid excess inventory and holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 28 units. This suggests we may need to adjust our orders to better align with demand trends. I encourage everyone to share their current inventory levels to help us coordinate more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory levels and recent demand data to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our orders.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak at 40 units. This suggests potential variability in future orders. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 123 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 28, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [57]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: 10.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 9, 8, 7. This suggests a potential decline in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 9, 8, 7. This suggests a potential decline in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to avoid excess inventory and holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 28 units. This suggests we may need to adjust our orders to better align with demand trends. I encourage everyone to share their current inventory levels to help us coordinate more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory levels and recent demand data to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our orders.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak at 40 units. This suggests potential variability in future orders. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 9, 8, 7. This suggests a potential decline in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand trend with decreasing orders: 9, 8, 7. This suggests a potential decline in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to avoid excess inventory and holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 28 units. This suggests we may need to adjust our orders to better align with demand trends. I encourage everyone to share their current inventory levels to help us coordinate more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory levels and recent demand data to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our orders.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak at 40 units. This suggests potential variability in future orders. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--------------------- Round 6 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [28, 40, 60, 80]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 7-8 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet demand without oversupplying.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 7-8 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain stock while anticipating potential demand, but I encourage everyone to share their expected demand for the next round to align our orders.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 109 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 7-8 units. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment and suggesting coordination to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better match the observed demand trends. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to maintain a buffer while considering the recent demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 146 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 7-8 units. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment and suggesting coordination to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to better match the observed demand trends. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet potential demand fluctuations while avoiding excess holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations while avoiding excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I currently have 103 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 196 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -52.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 28, 17, and 27 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to avoid stockouts and ensure smooth operations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 40, 29, and 42 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders to better align with this trend to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on observed demand patterns to reduce the bullwhip effect and ensure smoother operations across the supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 109 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: 52.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 28, 17, and 27 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to avoid stockouts and ensure smooth operations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 40, 29, and 42 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders to better align with this trend to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on observed demand patterns to reduce the bullwhip effect and ensure smoother operations across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Last round profit: 11.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 28, 17, and 27 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to avoid stockouts and ensure smooth operations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 40, 29, and 42 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders to better align with this trend to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on observed demand patterns to reduce the bullwhip effect and ensure smoother operations across the supply chain.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 103 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 29, 42]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 57.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 28, 17, and 27 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to avoid stockouts and ensure smooth operations.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 40, 29, and 42 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders to better align with this trend to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on observed demand patterns to reduce the bullwhip effect and ensure smoother operations across the supply chain.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order quantities to avoid excess inventory or backlog. Therefore, I will continue to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 218 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -69.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable inventory and no backlog, I will order to maintain stock while anticipating demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential fluctuations in demand could lead to excess inventory or backlog if not managed carefully.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the risk of backlog or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders of 7, 7, and 8 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should consider in our future orders. I encourage everyone to share their insights on demand patterns to better align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we meet demand without excessive holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 17, 27, and 28 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Therefore, I will be cautious in my ordering to avoid stockouts while also considering the risk of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any sudden spikes in demand while ensuring I do not overstock.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 160 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 27, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: 24.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the risk of backlog or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders of 7, 7, and 8 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should consider in our future orders. I encourage everyone to share their insights on demand patterns to better align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we meet demand without excessive holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 17, 27, and 28 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Therefore, I will be cautious in my ordering to avoid stockouts while also considering the risk of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any sudden spikes in demand while ensuring I do not overstock.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to order based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the risk of backlog or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders of 7, 7, and 8 units. This suggests a potential trend that we should consider in our future orders. I encourage everyone to share their insights on demand patterns to better align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we meet demand without excessive holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 17, 27, and 28 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Therefore, I will be cautious in my ordering to avoid stockouts while also considering the risk of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to help align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand due to seasonal trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any sudden spikes in demand while ensuring I do not overstock.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 237 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 8, 8]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: -69.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 8 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain efforts.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable at around 7 to 8 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce the bullwhip effect. If we can share our expected demand more transparently, it could help us all optimize our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 28 units. This suggests we may need to adjust our orders to better align with demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand without creating backlogs.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 136 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: -15.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 8 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain efforts.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable at around 7 to 8 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce the bullwhip effect. If we can share our expected demand more transparently, it could help us all optimize our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 28 units. This suggests we may need to adjust our orders to better align with demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand without creating backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on observed demand trends to minimize the bullwhip effect.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 152 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [42, 48, 24]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: 65.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 8 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain efforts.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable at around 7 to 8 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce the bullwhip effect. If we can share our expected demand more transparently, it could help us all optimize our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 28 units. This suggests we may need to adjust our orders to better align with demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand without creating backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on observed demand trends to minimize the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 9 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [28, 48, 73, 88]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand pattern with orders of 8, 8, and 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. I can only ship based on the orders plus my current backlog, so let's ensure we align our expectations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 255 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand pattern with orders of 8, 8, and 10 units, suggesting a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain stock while anticipating demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on anticipated demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 166 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand pattern suggesting a potential increase in demand. I also note that Wholesaler agrees and plans to order 20 units to maintain stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will order 20 units to cover anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on anticipated demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 279 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand pattern suggesting a potential increase in demand. I also note that Wholesaler and Distributor agree with this assessment and plan to order 20 units to maintain stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for potential demand increases. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while ensuring I can meet any future demand without creating excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively while maintaining a buffer to adapt to demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue to share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 255 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [18]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: -78.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable inventory and no backlog, I will order to maintain stock while anticipating demand.",

}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders of 8, 8, and 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. I can only ship based on the orders plus my current backlog, so let's ensure we align our expectations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating between 8 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will be cautious with my order to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for possible higher demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 16 and 28 units. This variability suggests we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial, but we must also be cautious of over-ordering. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our expected demand more transparently. Therefore, I will continue to order conservatively while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 48, 24, and 26 units. This suggests a potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders of 8, 8, and 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. I can only ship based on the orders plus my current backlog, so let's ensure we align our expectations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating between 8 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will be cautious with my order to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for possible higher demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Previous communication history:
        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 279 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 16, 18]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: -76.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders of 8, 8, and 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. I can only ship based on the orders plus my current backlog, so let's ensure we align our expectations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating between 8 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will be cautious with my order to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for possible higher demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 16 and 28 units. This variability suggests we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial, but we must also be cautious of over-ordering. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our expected demand more transparently. Therefore, I will continue to order conservatively while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 48, 24, and 26 units. This suggests a potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Last round profit: 41.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand trend with orders of 8, 8, and 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. I can only ship based on the orders plus my current backlog, so let's ensure we align our expectations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating between 8 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will be cautious with my order to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for possible higher demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 16 and 28 units. This variability suggests we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial, but we must also be cautious of over-ordering. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our expected demand more transparently. Therefore, I will continue to order conservatively while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 48, 24, and 26 units. This suggests a potential variability in demand that we should all be aware of. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

--------------------- Round 10 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 15
Shipments received per agent: [16, 24, 49, 64]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 15 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer for potential increases.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 256 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to demand changes.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our expectations for the next round's demand to optimize our orders. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain stock while anticipating potential demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I will continue to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 165 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to demand changes.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. I also note Wholesaler's agreement on aligning expectations for the next round's demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider recent demand trends to optimize our orders. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while being mindful of potential demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 303 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to demand changes.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. I also note Wholesaler and Distributor's agreement on aligning expectations for the next round's demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider the recent demand fluctuations, which have been increasing. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my order to prepare for potential demand increases while ensuring I do not overstock.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations while avoiding excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 219 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to respond flexibly to demand changes.

  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 15 units. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with the last three orders being 16, 18, and 25 units. This variability suggests we should be cautious about over-ordering. I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand data more frequently to align our orders better. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts while maintaining a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to improve our order accuracy and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders increasing to 35 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 165 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -33.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 15 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer for fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 15 units. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with the last three orders being 16, 18, and 25 units. This variability suggests we should be cautious about over-ordering. I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand data more frequently to align our orders better. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts while maintaining a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to improve our order accuracy and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders increasing to 35 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 15 units. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with the last three orders being 16, 18, and 25 units. This variability suggests we should be cautious about over-ordering. I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand data more frequently to align our orders better. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts while maintaining a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to improve our order accuracy and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders increasing to 35 units. This suggests a potential upward trend in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 219 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [24, 26, 35]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 26
          - Last round profit: -5.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 15 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer for fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 15 units. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
