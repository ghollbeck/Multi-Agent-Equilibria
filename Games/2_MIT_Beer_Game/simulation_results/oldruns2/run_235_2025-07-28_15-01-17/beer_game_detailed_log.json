Given the recent demand pattern of 10, 0, 10, 0, 10, 0, I plan to order in the range of 15-20 units this round to build some buffer inventory and reduce backlog. I suggest we collectively target a safety stock of 10-15 units across the supply chain to provide stable supply while minimizing costs. By working together to share demand forecasts and coordinate our ordering, we can improve profitability for all. I'm open to discussing a collaborative strategy that benefits the entire supply chain.",
