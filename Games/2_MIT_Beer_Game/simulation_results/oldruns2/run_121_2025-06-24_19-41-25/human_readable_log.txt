External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at -$4.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand while keeping an eye on my holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory while preparing for future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I have 43 units in inventory and no backlog, and I will be ordering 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current inventory is 43 units with no backlog, but my total profit is at -$4.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will aim to fulfill the Retailer's order while also considering future demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will balance my order to the Distributor to maintain inventory levels while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which could lead to increased holding costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is at -$4.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure we meet the Retailer's demand while managing our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to fulfill the expected demand and maintain a buffer for future fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to align with the Retailer's needs while managing my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which could lead to increased holding costs for all of us.
  Information Shared: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is at -$4.00, which highlights the need for stable supply chain operations.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production closely with these orders to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will schedule production of 20 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which could lead to increased holding costs for all of us.
  Information Shared: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is at -$4.00, highlighting the need for stable supply chain operations.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 43 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at -$4.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand while keeping an eye on my holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current inventory is 43 units with no backlog, but my total profit is at -$4.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will aim to fulfill the Retailer's order while also considering future demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which could lead to increased holding costs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 43 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 43 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 43 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at -$4.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand while keeping an eye on my holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current inventory is 43 units with no backlog, but my total profit is at -$4.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will aim to fulfill the Retailer's order while also considering future demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which could lead to increased holding costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure we meet the Retailer's demand while managing our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to fulfill the expected demand and maintain a buffer for future fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which could lead to increased holding costs for all of us.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for potential future demand, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production closely with these orders to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will schedule production of 20 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which could lead to increased holding costs for all of us.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 36 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at -$4.50, indicating a need for careful order management.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 16 units and order 20 units from the Distributor to cover the expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balance between fulfilling orders and managing inventory levels to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $55.50. I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so careful coordination is essential.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to prevent stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of aligning orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current situation shows 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which means I am unable to fulfill the full demand from the Wholesaler this round. Therefore, I will order 20 units from the Factory to cover my backlog and prepare for future demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected orders to avoid stockouts and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balance between fulfilling orders and managing my backlog to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to prevent stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of aligning orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 20 units, I am in a critical position that requires immediate attention. Therefore, I will prioritize scheduling production to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand to prevent further stockouts downstream.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current situation shows 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which means I am unable to fulfill the full demand from the Wholesaler this round.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 43]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [63]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 16 units and order 20 units from the Distributor to cover the expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to prevent stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of aligning orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current situation shows 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which means I am unable to fulfill the full demand from the Wholesaler this round. Therefore, I will order 20 units from the Factory to cover my backlog and prepare for future demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected orders to avoid stockouts and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to prevent stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of aligning orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 20 units, I am in a critical position that requires immediate attention. Therefore, I will prioritize scheduling production to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand to prevent further stockouts downstream.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stockouts or oversupply, which would hurt our profits.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $1.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the average demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill orders without careful planning.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stockouts. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units, which puts me in a precarious position. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected spikes.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, as my current backlog of 27 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production schedules accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could hurt all of our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $1.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the average demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stockouts. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units, which puts me in a precarious position. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the average demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, as my current backlog of 27 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production schedules accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy that reflects the average demand to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess inventory.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 40 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 27, 23]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 27
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (40 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $1.00, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the average demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and avoid stockouts. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units, which puts me in a precarious position. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders based on the average demand observed in the last rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects the average demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for alignment to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, as my current backlog of 27 units and zero inventory puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production schedules accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could hurt all of our profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our strategies and minimize costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 50 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $3.50 so far.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 50 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 23 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our strategies and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 23 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $151.50 so far. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our profits. This will help us prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler mentioned aligning our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to manage our inventory and backlog effectively to maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 37 units, which puts me in a critical position. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring a stable supply chain for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler's call for aligning our expected demand and inventory levels. Additionally, the Distributor's critical position with a backlog of 37 units highlights the urgency of our situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts that could hurt all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production and orders accordingly to maintain steady inventory levels and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 37 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [27, 23, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [126]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (37 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our strategies and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 23 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $151.50 so far. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our profits. This will help us prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler mentioned aligning our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to manage our inventory and backlog effectively to maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 37 units, which puts me in a critical position. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring a stable supply chain for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler's call for aligning our expected demand and inventory levels. Additionally, the Distributor's critical position with a backlog of 37 units highlights the urgency of our situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts that could hurt all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production and orders accordingly to maintain steady inventory levels and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [43, 7, 43]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 47
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our strategies and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 23 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $151.50 so far. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our profits. This will help us prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler mentioned aligning our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to manage our inventory and backlog effectively to maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 37 units, which puts me in a critical position. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring a stable supply chain for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler's call for aligning our expected demand and inventory levels. Additionally, the Distributor's critical position with a backlog of 37 units highlights the urgency of our situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts that could hurt all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production and orders accordingly to maintain steady inventory levels and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent any disruptions.

External demand (Retailer): 14
Shipments received per agent: [23, 7, 27, 81]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 59 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $9.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while coordinating with others.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $220.50, I have 0 units in inventory, and a backlog of 4 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders without careful planning.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 60 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders if demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while coordinating with others.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $84.50, I have 0 units in inventory, and a backlog of 60 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders without careful planning.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to stabilize our supply chain, and Distributor echoed the need for collaboration to prevent excessive backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all work together to ensure we have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding stockouts. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. We need to be cautious of the holding and backlog costs that can erode our profits, especially since I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production to meet the immediate backlog while considering future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $601.50, I have 0 units in inventory, and a backlog of 7 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders without careful planning.

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 59 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 59 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 60 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders if demand increases.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to stabilize our supply chain, and Distributor echoed the need for collaboration to prevent excessive backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all work together to ensure we have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding stockouts. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. We need to be cautious of the holding and backlog costs that can erode our profits, especially since I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 60 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [23, 20, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [81]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 57
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (60 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 59 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 60 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders if demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to stabilize our supply chain, and Distributor echoed the need for collaboration to prevent excessive backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all work together to ensure we have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding stockouts. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. We need to be cautious of the holding and backlog costs that can erode our profits, especially since I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 7 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 43, 27]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 47
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (7 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 59 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding excessive backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 60 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders if demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to stabilize our supply chain, and Distributor echoed the need for collaboration to prevent excessive backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all work together to ensure we have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding stockouts. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling downstream orders if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits. We need to be cautious of the holding and backlog costs that can erode our profits, especially since I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excess backlog or inventory.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--------------------- Round 6 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [20, 43, 126, 94]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 66 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $8.50, and I have 66 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and aligning our ordering strategies to maintain sufficient inventory levels across the chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while considering my current inventory and backlog situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory and avoid stock-outs, which could threaten our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 14 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $286.00.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent stockouts and ensure steady supply.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders and share our demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stock-outs, which could threaten our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 19 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $342.50.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady supply. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 103 units, which puts pressure on my production and affects the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and reduced profits for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on balancing production with current backlog and expected demand to optimize profits.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $682.00, with 0 units in inventory and 103 units in backlog.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 66 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 14, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 14 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 14, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [107]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 18
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 66 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory and avoid stock-outs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady supply. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 103 units, which puts pressure on my production and affects the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and reduced profits for all of us.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 103 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [43, 27, 107]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [210]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 34
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (103 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 66 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and aligning our ordering strategies to maintain sufficient inventory levels across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory and avoid stock-outs, which could threaten our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent stockouts and ensure steady supply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders and share our demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stock-outs, which could threaten our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the need for effective coordination to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady supply. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 103 units, which puts pressure on my production and affects the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and reduced profits for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and ensure steady supply across the chain.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 87 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-12.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 87 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on expected demand, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 18 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to avoid stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of inventory while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on expected demand, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 102 units and zero inventory puts me in a precarious position, threatening my profit of $699.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of inventory and prevent any potential stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the current backlog and expected demand to stabilize my inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our production and order quantities based on expected demand, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 87 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 18 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 87 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-12.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on expected demand, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of inventory while maximizing our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on expected demand, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 102 units and zero inventory puts me in a precarious position, threatening my profit of $699.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of inventory and prevent any potential stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our production and order quantities based on expected demand, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 63 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 29, 23]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [68]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 87 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-12.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to ensure we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on expected demand, ensuring we all maintain sufficient inventory levels and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of inventory while maximizing our profits.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current backlog of 102 units and zero inventory puts me in a precarious position, threatening my profit of $699.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of inventory and prevent any potential stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in supply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 102 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at -$28.50, indicating a need for careful order management.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 91 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $374.00. I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid risks of stockouts or oversupply.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 91 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in supply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 91 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $374.00. I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our expected demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together closely to ensure we avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 103 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $487.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. We must be cautious of potential market instability and ensure our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain a steady flow without oscillations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our expected demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together closely to ensure we avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. I currently have 239 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to support our collective needs. However, my profit of $1032.00 is at risk if we do not manage our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our production and ordering strategies, ensuring we all maximize our profits while preventing the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 103 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 23, 34]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [181]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in supply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 91 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $374.00. I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our expected demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together closely to ensure we avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 103 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $487.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. We must be cautious of potential market instability and ensure our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain a steady flow without oscillations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our expected demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together closely to ensure we avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. I currently have 239 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to support our collective needs. However, my profit of $1032.00 is at risk if we do not manage our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our production and ordering strategies, ensuring we all maximize our profits while preventing the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 239 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [107, 37, 54]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 139
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in supply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 91 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $374.00. I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid risks of stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our expected demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together closely to ensure we avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 103 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $487.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. We must be cautious of potential market instability and ensure our orders reflect realistic demand to maintain a steady flow without oscillations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our expected demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together closely to ensure we avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. I currently have 239 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to support our collective needs. However, my profit of $1032.00 is at risk if we do not manage our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our production and ordering strategies, ensuring we all maximize our profits while preventing the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 9 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [23, 37, 68, 278]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-52.00, which is concerning. I have 112 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if demand increases unexpectedly, I could face stock-outs. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet potential spikes in demand. This will help prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, which is crucial for maximizing our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round so we can align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 112 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $-52.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $391.00. I propose we discuss our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: Let's align our orders based on expected demand to maximize profits.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $391.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet potential spikes in demand while avoiding excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 130 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $524.50. I propose we align our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so planning is crucial. Let's ensure we maintain a steady flow in the supply chain to maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: Let's coordinate our orders based on expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply.

I currently have 446 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without creating excess stock. However, I am aware that if demand spikes unexpectedly, it could threaten my profit trajectory of $986.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our production and orders collectively, ensuring we all remain profitable while avoiding stock-outs and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 112 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 14, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-52.00, which is concerning. I have 112 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if demand increases unexpectedly, I could face stock-outs. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet potential spikes in demand. This will help prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, which is crucial for maximizing our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round so we can align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $391.00. I propose we discuss our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet potential spikes in demand while avoiding excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 130 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $524.50. I propose we align our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so planning is crucial. Let's ensure we maintain a steady flow in the supply chain to maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to ensure sufficient inventory and prevent stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need to align our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain to maximize our collective profits. I currently have 446 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without creating excess stock. However, I am aware that if demand spikes unexpectedly, it could threaten my profit trajectory of $986.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our production and orders collectively, ensuring we all remain profitable while avoiding stock-outs and oversupply.
  Proposal: I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.

I currently have 446 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without creating excess stock. However, I am aware that if demand spikes unexpectedly, it could threaten my profit trajectory of $986.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our production and orders collectively, ensuring we all remain profitable while avoiding stock-outs and oversupply.
  Proposal: I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 130 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [23, 34, 27]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [71]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-52.00, which is concerning. I have 112 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if demand increases unexpectedly, I could face stock-outs. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet potential spikes in demand. This will help prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, which is crucial for maximizing our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round so we can align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $391.00. I propose we discuss our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet potential spikes in demand while avoiding excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 130 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $524.50. I propose we align our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so planning is crucial. Let's ensure we maintain a steady flow in the supply chain to maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to ensure sufficient inventory and prevent stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need to align our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain to maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 446 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [37, 54, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 54
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-52.00, which is concerning. I have 112 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if demand increases unexpectedly, I could face stock-outs. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet potential spikes in demand. This will help prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, which is crucial for maximizing our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round so we can align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $391.00. I propose we discuss our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to ensure we all have sufficient inventory to meet potential spikes in demand while avoiding excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 130 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $524.50. I propose we align our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so planning is crucial. Let's ensure we maintain a steady flow in the supply chain to maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to ensure sufficient inventory and prevent stock-outs. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need to align our expected demand to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain to maximize our collective profits. I currently have 446 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without creating excess stock. However, I am aware that if demand spikes unexpectedly, it could threaten my profit trajectory of $986.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our production and orders collectively, ensuring we all remain profitable while avoiding stock-outs and oversupply.
  Proposal: I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-92.00, and I have 135 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 135 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 135 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [25]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 130 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-92.00, and I have 135 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for coordination to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 130 units and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders carefully to maximize our profits and avoid potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 272 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand and the impact on my profit of $486.00. We need to carefully plan our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. I currently have 487 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand and the impact on my profit of $910.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-92.00, and I have 135 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for coordination to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 130 units and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders carefully to maximize our profits and avoid potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 272 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand and the impact on my profit of $486.00. We need to carefully plan our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. I currently have 487 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand and the impact on my profit of $910.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 487 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [54, 41, 39]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 41
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 9. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 487 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [54, 41, 39]
          - Last order placed: 41
          - Total profit so far: $910.50
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",

}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [27, 41, 71, 82]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 156 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $-155.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain optimal inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts and oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 156 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 145 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 156 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain optimal inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 297 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $452.50. To maximize our collective profits, I propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly. This will help us maintain steady supply chain flow and prevent any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts or oversupply. My current profit is $848.00, and I have 495 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to maximize our collective profits while ensuring a steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 297 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [27, 25, 26]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [74]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 156 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain optimal inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 297 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $452.50. To maximize our collective profits, I propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly. This will help us maintain steady supply chain flow and prevent any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts or oversupply. My current profit is $848.00, and I have 495 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to maximize our collective profits while ensuring a steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 495 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [41, 39, 46]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 41
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 156 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain optimal inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts and oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 297 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $452.50. To maximize our collective profits, I propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly. This will help us maintain steady supply chain flow and prevent any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts or oversupply. My current profit is $848.00, and I have 495 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders accordingly to maximize our collective profits while ensuring a steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 172 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-218.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our forecasts and orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 162 units and no backlog, along with my total profit of $355.00, to emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders. We must be cautious of the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to market instability and affect all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of orders while avoiding excessive inventory. My current profit is $396.50, and I have 322 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 322 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [25, 26, 22]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [68]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 26
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 172 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-218.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our forecasts and orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 162 units and no backlog, along with my total profit of $355.00, to emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders. We must be cautious of the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to market instability and affect all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of orders while avoiding excessive inventory. My current profit is $396.50, and I have 322 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 507 units and no backlog, I can support our collective needs while avoiding excess stock. However, I am concerned about the risks of stockouts and oversupply that could threaten all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits and maintain a steady flow of orders.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 507 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [39, 46, 42]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 41
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 172 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-218.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our forecasts and orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which can threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 162 units and no backlog, along with my total profit of $355.00, to emphasize the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders. We must be cautious of the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to market instability and affect all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of orders while avoiding excessive inventory. My current profit is $396.50, and I have 322 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain stability and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 507 units and no backlog, I can support our collective needs while avoiding excess stock. However, I am concerned about the risks of stockouts and oversupply that could threaten all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we meet customer demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits and maintain a steady flow of orders.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-287.50, which is concerning. I have 188 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 188 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $-287.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they have 188 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet immediate demand. However, they expressed concern about potential stockouts or oversupply destabilizing the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 178 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $341.00. I propose we align our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain profitability across the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 188 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 178 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-287.50, which is concerning. I have 188 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

However, they expressed concern about potential stockouts or oversupply destabilizing the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 178 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $341.00.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and orders to maintain a steady flow of products and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 346 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $348.50. I propose we all communicate our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and prevent any potential market collapse.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 519 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [46, 42, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 42
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-287.50, which is concerning. I have 188 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 188 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet immediate demand. However, they expressed concern about potential stockouts or oversupply destabilizing the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 178 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is $341.00. I propose we align our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about stockouts or oversupply destabilizing the supply chain, and Wholesaler echoed the need for effective coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and orders to maintain a steady flow of products and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 346 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $348.50. I propose we all communicate our expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about stockouts or oversupply destabilizing the supply chain, and Wholesaler echoed the need for effective coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 519 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $692.50. I propose we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to avoid excess stock and ensure we meet demand without risking stockouts. Let's agree on expected demand for the next rounds to optimize our orders and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($692.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (519 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess inventory and stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing real-time demand data and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the most recent demand data to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 198 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-356.50, which highlights the need for careful order management to avoid further losses.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 198 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [22]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 198 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess inventory and stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing real-time demand data and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the most recent demand data to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better demand forecasting to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely with actual demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will continue to monitor recent demand trends and adjust my orders accordingly while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the most recent demand data and share our inventory levels to ensure we all have enough stock without oversupplying. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better demand forecasting to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must closely align our production and orders with actual demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will produce based on recent demand trends while ensuring we avoid overproduction, as I currently have 545 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet potential demand without creating excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and orders based on the most recent demand data to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 382 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [22, 30, 22]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [58]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 26
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-440.50. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. If we don't manage our inventory and orders effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which will hurt all of our profits. Let's work together to optimize our ordering strategies and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 218 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 228 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-440.50. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. If we don't manage our inventory and orders effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which will hurt all of our profits. Let's work together to optimize our ordering strategies and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. My current inventory is 228 units with no backlog, and my total profit is $233.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize costs and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler propose that we share our demand forecasts to optimize our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 427 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $99.00. I propose we align our orders based on recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to prevent stock-outs. This will help us all maximize our profits and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and minimize costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for better demand forecasting and coordination to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules closely with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stock-outs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 427 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 22, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [55]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-440.50. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. If we don't manage our inventory and orders effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which will hurt all of our profits. Let's work together to optimize our ordering strategies and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. My current inventory is 228 units with no backlog, and my total profit is $233.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize costs and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler propose that we share our demand forecasts to optimize our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 427 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $99.00. I propose we align our orders based on recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to prevent stock-outs. This will help us all maximize our profits and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and minimize costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for better demand forecasting and coordination to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules closely with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 586 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [50, 32, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 42
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-440.50. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. If we don't manage our inventory and orders effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which will hurt all of our profits. Let's work together to optimize our ordering strategies and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. My current inventory is 228 units with no backlog, and my total profit is $233.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize costs and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. I also heard the Wholesaler propose that we share our demand forecasts to optimize our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 427 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $99.00. I propose we align our orders based on recent demand trends and maintain a buffer to prevent stock-outs. This will help us all maximize our profits and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and minimize costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for better demand forecasting and coordination to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules closely with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stock-outs.

--------------------- Round 16 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 16
Shipments received per agent: [22, 32, 58, 74]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-512.50, which is a significant concern. I have 224 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, we must coordinate to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total profits. If we don't work together, we risk market instability and potential collapse, which would hurt everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 224 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit so far is $-512.50.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our strategies to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 224 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $211.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring that we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits. I currently have 429 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $24.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to market instability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 224 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 10, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-512.50, which is a significant concern. I have 224 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, we must coordinate to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total profits. If we don't work together, we risk market instability and potential collapse, which would hurt everyone's profits.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total profits while preventing the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 429 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [22, 20, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [81]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits. I currently have 429 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $24.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to market instability.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our strategies to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 579 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet potential demand. However, I am concerned about the risk of overproduction if demand drops unexpectedly, which could hurt my profit of $322.50.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 579 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 30, 56]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [56]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-512.50, which is a significant concern. I have 224 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, we must coordinate to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow. I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total profits. If we don't work together, we risk market instability and potential collapse, which would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our strategies to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 224 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $211.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring that we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits. I currently have 429 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $24.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could lead to market instability.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our strategies to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 579 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet potential demand. However, I am concerned about the risk of overproduction if demand drops unexpectedly, which could hurt my profit of $322.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maximize total profits while preventing the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--------------------- Round 17 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [20, 30, 55, 60]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 233 units and a backlog of 0 units. My profit so far is $-601.50, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to prevent oscillations in inventory levels. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid any risks of market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and production schedules, ensuring we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 233 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit trajectory is concerning at $-601.50.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect true market demand and prevent oscillations in inventory levels. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 223 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $177.00. It's crucial that we coordinate our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We should be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure our orders are based on actual demand to prevent market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer in my inventory while fulfilling orders based on recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders and production schedules, ensuring we meet customer demand without excess inventory.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 433 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit trajectory is concerning at $-64.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure our orders are based on actual demand, preventing excess inventory and stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer while fulfilling orders based on recent demand trends to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and production schedules effectively.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to reflect true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 563 units and no backlog, I can help stabilize our supply chain. However, I am concerned about the potential for market instability if we do not coordinate our production and orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure we align our orders and production schedules, preventing excess inventory and stockouts.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 233 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 16, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 223 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 16, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 233 units and a backlog of 0 units. My profit so far is $-601.50, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to prevent oscillations in inventory levels. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid any risks of market collapse.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and production schedules, ensuring we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect true market demand and prevent oscillations in inventory levels. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 223 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $177.00. It's crucial that we coordinate our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We should be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure our orders are based on actual demand to prevent market instability.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders and production schedules, ensuring we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to reflect true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 433 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit trajectory is concerning at $-64.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure our orders are based on actual demand, preventing excess inventory and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and production schedules effectively.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to reflect true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 563 units and no backlog, I can help stabilize our supply chain. However, I am concerned about the potential for market instability if we do not coordinate our production and orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure we align our orders and production schedules, preventing excess inventory and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and production schedules effectively.

        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 233 units and a backlog of 0 units. My profit so far is $-601.50, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to prevent oscillations in inventory levels. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid any risks of market collapse.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and production schedules, ensuring we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect true market demand and prevent oscillations in inventory levels. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 223 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $177.00. It's crucial that we coordinate our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We should be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure our orders are based on actual demand to prevent market instability.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders and production schedules, ensuring we meet customer demand without excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to reflect true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. I currently have 433 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit trajectory is concerning at $-64.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure our orders are based on actual demand, preventing excess inventory and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and production schedules effectively.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to reflect true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 563 units and no backlog, I can help stabilize our supply chain. However, I am concerned about the potential for market instability if we do not coordinate our production and orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure we align our orders and production schedules, preventing excess inventory and stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and production schedules effectively.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 563 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 56, 51]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

My profit so far is $-601.50, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to prevent oscillations in inventory levels. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid any risks of market collapse.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 258 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 256 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 258 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-703.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and ensure steady supply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and ensure steady supply.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet potential demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to ensure a steady flow of supply and maximize our collective profits.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 471 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 31, 23]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 258 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-703.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and ensure steady supply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and ensure steady supply.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and ensure steady supply across the chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet potential demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and order quantities accordingly to ensure a steady flow of supply and maximize our collective profits.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 258 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-703.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and ensure steady supply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to minimize fluctuations and ensure steady supply.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [31, 51, 76, 101]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have an inventory of 282 units and no backlog, but my total profit stands at $-826.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 282 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, my profit is currently negative, indicating a need for better coordination.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 280 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $34.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog. This means we need to be cautious about our order sizes to avoid potential stockouts or oversupply.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 500 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit stands at $-325.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire chain. I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also note that Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 610 units and no backlog, I can help stabilize our supply chain. However, my profit of $8.00 is threatened by potential oversupply or stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain, ensuring we all remain profitable.

          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:

I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 280 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.

- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 500 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit stands at $-325.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire chain. I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 280 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 500 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 23, 27]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [77]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have an inventory of 282 units and no backlog, but my total profit stands at $-826.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 280 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 500 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit stands at $-325.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire chain. I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also note that Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 610 units and no backlog, I can help stabilize our supply chain. However, my profit of $8.00 is threatened by potential oversupply or stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 610 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [51, 43, 47]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have an inventory of 282 units and no backlog, but my total profit stands at $-826.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 280 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 500 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit stands at $-325.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize the entire chain. I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also note that Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 610 units and no backlog, I can help stabilize our supply chain. However, my profit of $8.00 is threatened by potential oversupply or stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain, ensuring we all remain profitable.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-949.00, and I have 295 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a stable supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 295 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while fulfilling expected demand to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on our shared demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and maintain a steady flow of inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 302 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand while planning for future fluctuations.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid the bullwhip effect, which threatens my current profit of $-488.50. With 532 units in inventory and no backlog, I can fulfill expected demand, but we need to ensure our orders are aligned to prevent excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of inventory and maximize our total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a buffer while fulfilling expected demand to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on our shared demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 532 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand while planning for future fluctuations.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 295 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 7, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-949.00, and I have 295 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a stable supply chain.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 635 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [43, 47, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-949.00, and I have 295 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-139.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (635 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [27, 47, 77, 97]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 313 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1083.00, indicating a need for careful order management to improve profitability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 320 units and a backlog of 0 units, while also highlighting my total profit of $-152.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe that if we work together to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, we can optimize our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect all our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow without oscillations.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining inventory levels while coordinating orders to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and maximize total supply chain profits.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this by highlighting the need for careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and optimize our orders. I currently have 560 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-646.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure that we do not face stockouts or excessive holding costs, which threaten all our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a stable supply while coordinating orders to prevent stockouts.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is at $-289.50, and I have 660 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent any disruptions that could threaten our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 313 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 320 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 320 units and a backlog of 0 units, while also highlighting my total profit of $-152.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe that if we work together to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, we can optimize our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect all our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow without oscillations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this by highlighting the need for careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and optimize our orders. I currently have 560 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-646.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure that we do not face stockouts or excessive holding costs, which threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is at $-289.50, and I have 660 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent any disruptions that could threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect all our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow without oscillations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and maximize total supply chain profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 560 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [27, 21, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [72]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 23
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 320 units and a backlog of 0 units, while also highlighting my total profit of $-152.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe that if we work together to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, we can optimize our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect all our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow without oscillations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this by highlighting the need for careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and optimize our orders. I currently have 560 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-646.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure that we do not face stockouts or excessive holding costs, which threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is at $-289.50, and I have 660 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent any disruptions that could threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect all our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow without oscillations.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 320 units and a backlog of 0 units, while also highlighting my total profit of $-152.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe that if we work together to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, we can optimize our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect all our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow without oscillations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in the supply chain, and the Wholesaler echoed this by highlighting the need for careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and optimize our orders. I currently have 560 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-646.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to better align our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure that we do not face stockouts or excessive holding costs, which threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels each round to optimize our orders and maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful order management to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is at $-289.50, and I have 660 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent any disruptions that could threaten our profits. We need to be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect all our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we need to plan our orders carefully to ensure a steady flow without oscillations.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--------------------- Round 22 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [21, 41, 68, 84]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-1223.00, and I have 325 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 325 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 342 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing that my profit is currently at $-275.50. I believe that if we work together to manage our orders and maintain steady inventory levels, we can prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten all our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 325 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 342 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 599 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 29, 19]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-1223.00, and I have 325 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 342 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing that my profit is currently at $-275.50. I believe that if we work together to manage our orders and maintain steady inventory levels, we can prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent any disruptions that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we maintain steady inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent disruptions that could threaten our profits. My current profit is $-499.50, and I have 690 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we maintain steady inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stockouts or oversupply.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 690 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [41, 49, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-1223.00, and I have 325 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 342 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing that my profit is currently at $-275.50. I believe that if we work together to manage our orders and maintain steady inventory levels, we can prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent any disruptions that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we maintain steady inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent disruptions that could threaten our profits. My current profit is $-499.50, and I have 690 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we maintain steady inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stockouts or oversupply.

--------------------- Round 23 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [29, 49, 72, 94]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 341 units and a backlog of 0 units. My total profit so far is $-1361.00, which highlights the need for coordinated efforts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all parties involved.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us maintain steady inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Information Shared: I am currently holding 341 units with no backlog, and my last order was 20 units. I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 341 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 618 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 19, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [76]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 23
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 708 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [49, 29, 53]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $-1508.00, and I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My inventory stands at 349 units with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I have 349 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stockouts, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 349 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 366 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $-1508.00, and I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My inventory stands at 349 units with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stockouts, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 631 units and no backlog, highlighting that I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am concerned about the risks of stockouts if demand increases suddenly. We must coordinate our orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to prevent the bullwhip effect, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our profits.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $-1508.00, and I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My inventory stands at 349 units with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stockouts, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.

- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 631 units and no backlog, highlighting that I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am concerned about the risks of stockouts if demand increases suddenly. We must coordinate our orders carefully to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 709 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 53, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 23. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 709 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [29, 53, 41]
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Total profit so far: $-848.00
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

  "order_quantity": 20
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 372 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-1669.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. Based on my situation, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders better and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 372 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 389 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 372 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-1669.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. Based on my situation, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders better and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 389 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit stands at $-622.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared expected demand to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders based on expected demand to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit stands at $-1493.00, which is concerning, and I have 666 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared expected demand to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit stands at $-1059.00, and I have 747 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of overproduction or stock-outs, as these could destabilize our profits further.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand and production levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 666 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [33, 21, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [65]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 24
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 372 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-1669.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. Based on my situation, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders better and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 389 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit stands at $-622.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared expected demand to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders based on expected demand to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit stands at $-1493.00, which is concerning, and I have 666 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared expected demand to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit stands at $-1059.00, and I have 747 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of overproduction or stock-outs, as these could destabilize our profits further.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand and production levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 747 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [53, 41, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 41
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 372 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-1669.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. Based on my situation, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders better and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. I currently have 389 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit stands at $-622.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared expected demand to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders based on expected demand to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit stands at $-1493.00, which is concerning, and I have 666 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared expected demand to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. My current profit stands at $-1059.00, and I have 747 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of overproduction or stock-outs, as these could destabilize our profits further.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand and production levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

External demand (Retailer): 16
Shipments received per agent: [21, 41, 68, 82]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 377 units and a backlog of 0 units. My total profit so far is $-1817.50, which highlights the urgency for us to coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to prevent oscillations in inventory levels. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and avoid stockouts or oversupply.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 394 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-729.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 678 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-1692.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.

        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 377 units and a backlog of 0 units. My total profit so far is $-1817.50, which highlights the urgency for us to coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to prevent oscillations in inventory levels. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better and maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 678 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 30, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [86]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 377 units and a backlog of 0 units. My total profit so far is $-1817.50, which highlights the urgency for us to coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to prevent oscillations in inventory levels. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 394 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-729.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared expected demand to optimize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need for alignment in our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 678 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-1692.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared expected demand to optimize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for effective communication to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. With my current inventory at 743 units and no backlog, I am in a strong position to support our collective needs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to align our production and orders effectively, ensuring we avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's align our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stockouts or oversupply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 743 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [41, 41, 56]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [56]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 41
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 377 units and a backlog of 0 units. My total profit so far is $-1817.50, which highlights the urgency for us to coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. We must be cautious of the bullwhip effect and ensure that our orders reflect true market demand to prevent oscillations in inventory levels. I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 394 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-729.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared expected demand to optimize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed the need for alignment in our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. I currently have 678 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-1692.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared expected demand to optimize our supply chain and avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the need for effective communication to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. With my current inventory at 743 units and no backlog, I am in a strong position to support our collective needs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to align our production and orders effectively, ensuring we avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's align our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stockouts or oversupply.

--------------------- Round 27 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [30, 41, 65, 82]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-2003.00, which is concerning. I currently have 401 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet immediate demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all our profits. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 401 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid these risks. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 409 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-868.50. This situation is precarious, and if we do not align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts, we risk further losses. I propose we establish a joint strategy to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain, ensuring we maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 409 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all our profits. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the need for coordination to avoid further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a stable supply while avoiding excessive inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a joint strategy to align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 697 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about the holding costs affecting my profit of $-1925.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all our profits. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the need for coordination to avoid further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce a quantity that balances our current inventory of 749 units and the recent demand trends to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our production schedules accordingly to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 749 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about the holding costs affecting my profit of $-1400.00.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 401 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 16, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 16, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-2003.00, which is concerning. I currently have 401 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet immediate demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all our profits. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 749 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [41, 56, 46]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 56
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

External demand (Retailer): 15
Shipments received per agent: [36, 56, 86, 112]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 422 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-2176.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 422 units, and I have no backlog. My last order was 16 units, and I expect demand to rise to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders and forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
  Information Shared: I currently have 434 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1008.00. I expect demand to rise to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the need for coordinated orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and agree on order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory without excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a buffer while fulfilling expected demand to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders and forecasts, ensuring we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 732 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-2164.00. I can only ship orders equal to the Wholesaler's order plus my backlog, so timely coordination is crucial.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the need for coordinated orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and agree on order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory without excessive holding costs. My current profit is $-1587.50, and I have 780 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows us to be proactive in our production scheduling to meet potential demand while avoiding excess stock. We must be cautious of the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to increased holding costs and impact our overall profitability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 422 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 434 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 422 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-2176.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders and forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the need for coordinated orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and agree on order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory without excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders and forecasts, ensuring we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the need for coordinated orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and agree on order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory without excessive holding costs. My current profit is $-1587.50, and I have 780 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows us to be proactive in our production scheduling to meet potential demand while avoiding excess stock. We must be cautious of the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to increased holding costs and impact our overall profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 732 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 26, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [81]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 422 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-2176.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders and forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the need for coordinated orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and agree on order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory without excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders and forecasts, ensuring we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the need for coordinated orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and agree on order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory without excessive holding costs. My current profit is $-1587.50, and I have 780 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows us to be proactive in our production scheduling to meet potential demand while avoiding excess stock. We must be cautious of the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to increased holding costs and impact our overall profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and agree on order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of inventory without excessive holding costs. My current profit is $-1587.50, and I have 780 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows us to be proactive in our production scheduling to meet potential demand while avoiding excess stock. We must be cautious of the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as they can lead to increased holding costs and impact our overall profitability.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 440 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2376.50, which indicates that we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly to maintain a buffer while minimizing costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 452 units and no backlog, while emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-1164.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe we all need to work together to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory. We should align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 440 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 15, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my inventory of 794 units and no backlog, as my current profit of $-1789.50 is threatened by potential stockouts or oversupply. Let's coordinate our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 452 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 15, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 440 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2376.50, which indicates that we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly to maintain a buffer while minimizing costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 452 units and no backlog, while emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-1164.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe we all need to work together to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory. We should align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 760 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [26, 31, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [78]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 440 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2376.50, which indicates that we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly to maintain a buffer while minimizing costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 452 units and no backlog, while emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-1164.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe we all need to work together to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory. We should align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory, as my current profit is $-2424.00, which is threatened by potential stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share my inventory status of 760 units and no backlog, and propose that we align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits while avoiding market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain steady inventory levels. Distributor also mentioned the need for alignment to maximize profits while avoiding market collapse. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our production and inventory levels are aligned with demand to prevent excess stock and backlog. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my inventory of 794 units and no backlog, as my current profit of $-1789.50 is threatened by potential stockouts or oversupply. Let's coordinate our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 794 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [46, 51, 48]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 51
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 440 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-2376.50, which indicates that we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly to maintain a buffer while minimizing costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain steady inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 452 units and no backlog, while emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-1164.00. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe we all need to work together to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory. We should align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without excess inventory, as my current profit is $-2424.00, which is threatened by potential stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share my inventory status of 760 units and no backlog, and propose that we align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits while avoiding market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to optimize our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain steady inventory levels. Distributor also mentioned the need for alignment to maximize profits while avoiding market collapse. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our production and inventory levels are aligned with demand to prevent excess stock and backlog. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my inventory of 794 units and no backlog, as my current profit of $-1789.50 is threatened by potential stockouts or oversupply. Let's coordinate our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.

External demand (Retailer): 17
Shipments received per agent: [31, 51, 81, 102]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 454 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-2561.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent any disruptions.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 454 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, my profit situation is concerning, and I need to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 471 units and a backlog of 0 units, while emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-1319.50. This situation threatens my ability to fulfill future orders if demand increases unexpectedly. I propose that we align our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize the entire supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so planning is essential.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 454 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 8, 17]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 454 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-2561.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 471 units and a backlog of 0 units, while emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-1319.50. This situation threatens my ability to fulfill future orders if demand increases unexpectedly. I propose that we align our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize the entire supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so planning is essential.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 471 units and a backlog of 0 units, while emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-1319.50. This situation threatens my ability to fulfill future orders if demand increases unexpectedly. I propose that we align our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize the entire supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so planning is essential.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. My current profit is at $-2703.50, which is concerning, and I have 794 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of supply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 821 units and a backlog of 0 units, while highlighting my total profit of $-2012.50. I propose we regularly update each other on our expected demand to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of supply, as my shipment constraints allow me to ship only what is ordered plus my backlog. Let's focus on joint strategies to keep our profits from declining further.
  Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 794 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 28, 32]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [75]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 821 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [51, 48, 47]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 48
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 454 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-2561.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 471 units and a backlog of 0 units, while emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-1319.50. This situation threatens my ability to fulfill future orders if demand increases unexpectedly. I propose that we align our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize the entire supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so planning is essential.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. My current profit is at $-2703.50, which is concerning, and I have 794 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of supply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand and inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 821 units and a backlog of 0 units, while highlighting my total profit of $-2012.50. I propose we regularly update each other on our expected demand to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of supply, as my shipment constraints allow me to ship only what is ordered plus my backlog. Let's focus on joint strategies to keep our profits from declining further.
  Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-2012.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (821 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--------------------- Round 31 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [28, 48, 78, 96]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying. This will help stabilize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 473 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is -$2775.00, which highlights the need for careful planning to improve our financial situation.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a buffer while fulfilling expected demand to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits and prevent market collapse.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 490 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of -$1492.00. This highlights the need for careful planning to improve our financial situation.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits, especially since my current profit is -$2992.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying. I currently have 823 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious of potential stockouts or oversupply that could threaten our profits and lead to market instability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 473 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 17, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 490 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 17, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying. This will help stabilize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits and prevent market collapse.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits, especially since my current profit is -$2992.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying. I currently have 823 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious of potential stockouts or oversupply that could threaten our profits and lead to market instability. Let's coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent stockouts. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful coordination to avoid oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits, especially since my current profit is -$2234.00. I have 838 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while avoiding excess stock. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders accordingly to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits and prevent market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying.

• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 823 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 32, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [79]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand patterns to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying. This will help stabilize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits and prevent market collapse.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits, especially since my current profit is -$2992.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying. I currently have 823 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious of potential stockouts or oversupply that could threaten our profits and lead to market instability. Let's coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent stockouts. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for careful coordination to avoid oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our profits, especially since my current profit is -$2234.00. I have 838 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while avoiding excess stock. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders accordingly to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying, which will help stabilize our profits and prevent market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to ensure we all have sufficient inventory without oversupplying.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--------------------- Round 32 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [32, 47, 75, 95]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $-3003.50, and I have 497 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 497 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 514 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders carefully to prevent any disruptions.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining steady inventory levels while being cautious of potential demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit stands at $-1691.50, and I have 514 units in inventory with no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our inventory levels are stable and that we avoid the bullwhip effect. I currently have 855 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit stands at $-3312.50, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to maintain a steady supply chain and prevent any disruptions that could hurt all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between fulfilling demand and avoiding excessive inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 497 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 514 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [17, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $-3003.50, and I have 497 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 514 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders carefully to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our inventory levels are stable and that we avoid the bullwhip effect. I currently have 855 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit stands at $-3312.50, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to maintain a steady supply chain and prevent any disruptions that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current profit at $-2481.50 and an inventory of 860 units with no backlog, we must work together to ensure our inventory levels are stable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 855 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 29, 23]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $-3003.50, and I have 497 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 514 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders carefully to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our inventory levels are stable and that we avoid the bullwhip effect. I currently have 855 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit stands at $-3312.50, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to maintain a steady supply chain and prevent any disruptions that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current profit at $-2481.50 and an inventory of 860 units with no backlog, we must work together to ensure our inventory levels are stable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 860 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [47, 49, 43]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 48
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit stands at $-3003.50, and I have 497 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 514 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders carefully to prevent any disruptions.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our inventory levels are stable and that we avoid the bullwhip effect. I currently have 855 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit stands at $-3312.50, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to maintain a steady supply chain and prevent any disruptions that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to regularly share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current profit at $-2481.50 and an inventory of 860 units with no backlog, we must work together to ensure our inventory levels are stable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 518 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-3242.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk destabilizing the supply chain, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while ensuring I can meet immediate demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I have 518 units in inventory and no backlog, and I plan to order 20 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 535 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting that I can fulfill orders while maintaining a buffer. I urge everyone to coordinate our order quantities to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a balance between fulfilling orders and managing inventory to avoid excess costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 535 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit so far is $-1889.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our order quantities to avoid excessive inventory and ensure we can meet demand effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-3635.50, and with 886 units in inventory and no backlog, I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious of potential stockouts or oversupply that could threaten our profits. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in our supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 518 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 518 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-3242.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk destabilizing the supply chain, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while ensuring I can meet immediate demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 535 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting that I can fulfill orders while maintaining a buffer. I urge everyone to coordinate our order quantities to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our order quantities to avoid excessive inventory and ensure we can meet demand effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-3635.50, and with 886 units in inventory and no backlog, I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious of potential stockouts or oversupply that could threaten our profits. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in our supply chain.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 886 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 23, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [76]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 518 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-3242.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk destabilizing the supply chain, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while ensuring I can meet immediate demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 535 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting that I can fulfill orders while maintaining a buffer. I urge everyone to coordinate our order quantities to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our order quantities to avoid excessive inventory and ensure we can meet demand effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-3635.50, and with 886 units in inventory and no backlog, I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious of potential stockouts or oversupply that could threaten our profits. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and order quantities to avoid excessive inventory and ensure we can meet demand effectively. My current profit is $-2732.00, and I have 881 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability, as any misalignment could threaten all our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 881 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [49, 43, 48]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [48]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 518 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-3242.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk destabilizing the supply chain, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while ensuring I can meet immediate demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 535 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting that I can fulfill orders while maintaining a buffer. I urge everyone to coordinate our order quantities to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our order quantities to avoid excessive inventory and ensure we can meet demand effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability. My current profit is $-3635.50, and with 886 units in inventory and no backlog, I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious of potential stockouts or oversupply that could threaten our profits. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid oscillations in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stockouts and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need to align our strategies to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and order quantities to avoid excessive inventory and ensure we can meet demand effectively. My current profit is $-2732.00, and I have 881 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent market instability, as any misalignment could threaten all our profits.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [23, 43, 73, 88]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-3474.00, which is a significant concern. With 528 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet immediate demand, but we need to coordinate to prevent the bullwhip effect. If we all overreact to demand changes, it could lead to instability in the supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and stabilize the flow of goods.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 528 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-2115.00, which is concerning, and I have 557 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and maintain open communication about our inventory levels to optimize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently and coordinate our orders to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive inventory or stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a stable supply while managing my inventory effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 918 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders to avoid excess holding costs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor echo this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and order strategy to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 528 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 557 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 900 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [43, 48, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-3474.00, which is a significant concern. With 528 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet immediate demand, but we need to coordinate to prevent the bullwhip effect. If we all overreact to demand changes, it could lead to instability in the supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and stabilize the flow of goods.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-2115.00, which is concerning, and I have 557 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [28, 48, 76, 93]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-3719.00, and I have 545 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 545 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. I currently have 574 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-2324.50, which is a significant concern. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a buffer in inventory while responding to recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 574 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits. My current profit is $-4336.00, and I have 943 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill expected demand, but we need to be cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain stability in the supply chain and prevent any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady supply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 545 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 574 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-3719.00, and I have 545 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. I currently have 574 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-2324.50, which is a significant concern. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits. My current profit is $-4336.00, and I have 943 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill expected demand, but we need to be cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain stability in the supply chain and prevent any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to align our production and orders to maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-3281.00, and I have 918 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am cautious about overproducing, which could lead to higher holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and orders accordingly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits while maintaining stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and coordinate our production and orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 943 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [28, 21, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [75]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 24
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-3719.00, and I have 545 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. I currently have 574 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-2324.50, which is a significant concern. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits. My current profit is $-4336.00, and I have 943 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill expected demand, but we need to be cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain stability in the supply chain and prevent any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to align our production and orders to maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-3281.00, and I have 918 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am cautious about overproducing, which could lead to higher holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and orders accordingly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits while maintaining stability in the supply chain.

- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-3719.00, and I have 545 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. I currently have 574 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-2324.50, which is a significant concern. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits. My current profit is $-4336.00, and I have 943 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill expected demand, but we need to be cautious about future fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain stability in the supply chain and prevent any potential collapse that could hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for careful coordination to avoid both stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to align our production and orders to maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-3281.00, and I have 918 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am cautious about overproducing, which could lead to higher holding costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production and orders accordingly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits while maintaining stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and coordinate our production and orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 559 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-3981.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total supply chain profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while considering future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I have 559 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit trajectory is currently negative, which threatens our overall supply chain stability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 559 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [18]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 597 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 974 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 31, 18]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [66]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {

  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 559 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-3981.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total supply chain profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and maximize total supply chain profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the need for effective coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders and forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and improve our profit trajectories. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need for effective coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules and forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and improve our profit trajectories. Therefore, I will produce to meet potential demand while avoiding excess stock, given my current inventory of 937 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 937 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [41, 51, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 559 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-3981.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total supply chain profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 577 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4237.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to align our supply chain efforts and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 577 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 7, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

We need to be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excessive holding costs and potential stockouts. Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we can all meet demand without risking market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain efforts and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our production and ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will produce 50 units this round to meet potential demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 996 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 18, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [76]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 23
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 962 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [51, 38, 53]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 577 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4237.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to align our supply chain efforts and avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to align our efforts. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. My current profit is $-2803.00, and I have 615 units in inventory with no backlog. We need to work together to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain efforts.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to align our orders and forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 996 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-5093.50, which is concerning. We need to be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excessive holding costs and potential stockouts. Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we can all meet demand without risking market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain efforts and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all align our production and ordering strategies to stabilize our supply chain and protect our profits. Therefore, I will produce 50 units this round to meet potential demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain efforts and prevent any potential market collapse.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--------------------- Round 38 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [18, 38, 66, 88]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 586 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4507.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 586 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently at $-4507.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 631 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-3063.50. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe that if we all communicate our demand forecasts transparently, we can optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect everyone's profits. I propose we agree on a joint strategy to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize inventory levels.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. My current profit is $-5498.50, which is concerning, and I have 1020 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize inventory levels and maximize profits.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities, and Distributor echoed the need for collaboration to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our current inventory and demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 978 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-4184.50. I propose we agree on a joint strategy to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, as this will help us all maximize our profits and prevent market instability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 586 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [22]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 631 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 586 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4507.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 631 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-3063.50. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe that if we all communicate our demand forecasts transparently, we can optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect everyone's profits. I propose we agree on a joint strategy to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to adjust our orders accordingly.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. My current profit is $-5498.50, which is concerning, and I have 1020 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities, and Distributor echoed the need for collaboration to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our current inventory and demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 978 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-4184.50. I propose we agree on a joint strategy to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, as this will help us all maximize our profits and prevent market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to adjust our orders accordingly and minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 586 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4507.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 631 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing that my total profit is currently at $-3063.50. This situation threatens my profit trajectory, and I believe that if we all communicate our demand forecasts transparently, we can optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect everyone's profits. I propose we agree on a joint strategy to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to adjust our orders accordingly.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs. My current profit is $-5498.50, which is concerning, and I have 1020 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can lead to market instability and affect everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities, and Distributor echoed the need for collaboration to stabilize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our current inventory and demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 978 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-4184.50. I propose we agree on a joint strategy to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain, as this will help us all maximize our profits and prevent market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to adjust our orders accordingly and minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 586 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4507.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and minimize holding and backlog costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 37. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 607 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4781.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 607 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 652 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 607 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4781.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 652 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-3309.50, which is concerning. We need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while avoiding excessive inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 1054 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-5920.50, which is concerning. We need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid further losses and potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while avoiding excessive inventory. My current profit is $-4527.00, and I have 1015 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production schedules accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking, while also being mindful of the holding costs that can further impact our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production schedules accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1054 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [33, 22, 32]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [66]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 24
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 607 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4781.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 652 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-3309.50, which is concerning. We need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while avoiding excessive inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 1054 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-5920.50, which is concerning. We need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid further losses and potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while avoiding excessive inventory. My current profit is $-4527.00, and I have 1015 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production schedules accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking, while also being mindful of the holding costs that can further impact our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production schedules accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1015 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [53, 42, 42]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 42
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 607 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-4781.00, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 652 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-3309.50, which is concerning. We need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid further losses.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while avoiding excessive inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 1054 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-5920.50, which is concerning. We need to be cautious about our ordering strategies to avoid further losses and potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while avoiding excessive inventory. My current profit is $-4527.00, and I have 1015 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production schedules accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking, while also being mindful of the holding costs that can further impact our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production schedules accordingly to ensure we meet customer needs without overstocking.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 615 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-5053.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to align our supply chain efforts and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 615 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 12, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1088 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [22, 32, 26]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [68]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 615 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-5053.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to align our supply chain efforts and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and propose that we regularly communicate our expected demand and order quantities.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to align our demand forecasts and order quantities to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to align our demand forecasts and order quantities to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits. My current profit is $-4872.50, and I have 1031 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to produce strategically to meet potential demand while avoiding excess stock, but we must be cautious of market instability and the costs associated with holding and backlog.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1031 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [42, 42, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 42
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 615 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-5053.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to align our supply chain efforts and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stockouts and propose that we regularly communicate our expected demand and order quantities.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to align our demand forecasts and order quantities to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and maximize total profits. My current profit is $-4872.50, and I have 1031 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to produce strategically to meet potential demand while avoiding excess stock, but we must be cautious of market instability and the costs associated with holding and backlog.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,
          "backlog": 0,
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,
          "rationale": "<brief explanation of your reasoning>",
          "risk_assessment": "<describe any risks you anticipate>",
          "expected_demand_next_round": <integer>,
          "order_quantity": <integer>
        }

        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no markdown, no triple backticks, no code fences, and do NOT write the word 'json' anywhere. Your reply must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else. If you include anything else, your answer will be rejected. KEEP IT RATHER SHORT
