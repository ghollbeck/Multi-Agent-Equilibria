--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and backlog costs in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to stay aligned on demand forecasting to minimize excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will focus on placing an order that balances our inventory while preparing for expected demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer to absorb demand fluctuations while avoiding stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and inventory levels, which will help reduce the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 116, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 7, Profit: 35.00, Total Profit: -39.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=Current inventory meets expected demand, but a buffer is needed to prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=Low demand fluctuations may lead to excess inventory; maintaining a buffer is essential., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=103, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[7], llm_incoming=[7], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 103 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "Current inventory is sufficient to meet expected demand while avoiding backlog costs.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential fluctuations in demand could lead to stockouts; maintaining a buffer is crucial.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand was only 7 units, which suggests a potential decrease in consumption patterns. I recommend we align our orders to prevent excess inventory and backlog. Effective communication regarding demand forecasts could help us adjust our strategies accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on demand forecasts to help each agent adjust their orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory to meet demand is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure clear communication about our inventory levels and expected demands to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to maintain a buffer against any unexpected demand increase, while also sharing my current inventory situation with you all.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on the expected demand trends to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that coordination among us is crucial to address the demand fluctuations effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing our demand forecasts can help us all manage our inventories better. Therefore, I will be placing an order for 20 units to prepare for the expected demand and ensure we minimize any potential stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have noticed that demand has recently been at 7 units, which may indicate a stable but low demand pattern. Itâ€™s crucial that we all align our inventory levels to prevent stockouts and minimize backlogs. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about maintaining adequate stock levels, which aligns with my approach to ensure a buffer in my inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider our order quantities carefully to avoid overreacting to demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to maintain my inventory without risking overstock.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts weekly to help align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand was 7 units, which is significantly lower than the expected demand of 20 units for the next round. This discrepancy could lead to inventory challenges. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand and avoid excess inventory or backlog. I also recommend sharing real-time sales data to enhance our forecasting accuracy.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand updates to synchronize our supply chain efforts.
- Factory: I currently hold 103 units of inventory and have noted a recent demand of 7 units. I am prepared to handle future demand fluctuations, but I also recognize the risk of increased demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to ensure we maintain a buffer. Let's ensure we communicate our demand forecasts more frequently to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts among all agents to improve our inventory management and reduce unnecessary ordering.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 103 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand was only 7 units, which suggests a potential decrease in consumption patterns. I recommend we align our orders to prevent excess inventory and backlog. Effective communication regarding demand forecasts could help us adjust our strategies accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on demand forecasts to help each agent adjust their orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory to meet demand is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure clear communication about our inventory levels and expected demands to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to maintain a buffer against any unexpected demand increase, while also sharing my current inventory situation with you all.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on the expected demand trends to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that coordination among us is crucial to address the demand fluctuations effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing our demand forecasts can help us all manage our inventories better. Therefore, I will be placing an order for 20 units to prepare for the expected demand and ensure we minimize any potential stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have noticed that demand has recently been at 7 units, which may indicate a stable but low demand pattern. Itâ€™s crucial that we all align our inventory levels to prevent stockouts and minimize backlogs. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about maintaining adequate stock levels, which aligns with my approach to ensure a buffer in my inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider our order quantities carefully to avoid overreacting to demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to maintain my inventory without risking overstock.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts weekly to help align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand was 7 units, which is significantly lower than the expected demand of 20 units for the next round. This discrepancy could lead to inventory challenges. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand and avoid excess inventory or backlog. I also recommend sharing real-time sales data to enhance our forecasting accuracy.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand updates to synchronize our supply chain efforts.
- Factory: I currently hold 103 units of inventory and have noted a recent demand of 7 units. I am prepared to handle future demand fluctuations, but I also recognize the risk of increased demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to ensure we maintain a buffer. Let's ensure we communicate our demand forecasts more frequently to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts among all agents to improve our inventory management and reduce unnecessary ordering.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 120 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -23.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand spikes with orders reaching up to 26 units. This indicates potential fluctuations in demand. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels and order timing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate better to mitigate overstock and potential backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 20 units to balance supply and demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 47 units in inventory and have noted recent demand spikes. I hear that the demand may increase, which could impact all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more closely to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to prepare for potential demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been steady with orders of 7 and 6 units. I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more frequently about inventory levels to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 20 units to ensure I can meet potential increases in demand while keeping a safety stock.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our inventory and demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that demand appears to be fluctuating, and we need to adjust our strategies accordingly. It seems like we all need to be more aligned in our ordering to minimize the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while also being open to adjusting my next order quantity based on the collective insights we gather.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can better align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations, particularly a spike with the last order. This suggests potential variability in consumer preferences. I urge everyone to share their upcoming demand forecasts to better align our inventory strategies and mitigate the bullwhip effect. Additionally, maintaining balanced order quantities can help us all avoid excess inventory or backlog issues.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear there may be increased demand based on recent orders. This highlights the need for better coordination to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to better match projected demand. Therefore, I will order 50 units to prepare for potential demand spikes while maintaining a buffer in inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts with each other to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

  Proposal: I propose that we all share our inventory and demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that demand appears to be fluctuating, and we need to adjust our strategies accordingly. It seems like we all need to be more aligned in our ordering to minimize the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while also being open to adjusting my next order quantity based on the collective insights we gather.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can better align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations, particularly a spike with the last order. This suggests potential variability in consumer preferences. I urge everyone to share their upcoming demand forecasts to better align our inventory strategies and mitigate the bullwhip effect. Additionally, maintaining balanced order quantities can help us all avoid excess inventory or backlog issues.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear there may be increased demand based on recent orders. This highlights the need for better coordination to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to better match projected demand. Therefore, I will order 50 units to prepare for potential demand spikes while maintaining a buffer in inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts with each other to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 48.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand spikes with orders reaching up to 26 units. This indicates potential fluctuations in demand. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels and order timing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate better to mitigate overstock and potential backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 20 units to balance supply and demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 47 units in inventory and have noted recent demand spikes. I hear that the demand may increase, which could impact all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more closely to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to prepare for potential demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been steady with orders of 7 and 6 units. I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more frequently about inventory levels to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 20 units to ensure I can meet potential increases in demand while keeping a safety stock.

Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while also being open to adjusting my next order quantity based on the collective insights we gather.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can better align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations, particularly a spike with the last order. This suggests potential variability in consumer preferences. I urge everyone to share their upcoming demand forecasts to better align our inventory strategies and mitigate the bullwhip effect. Additionally, maintaining balanced order quantities can help us all avoid excess inventory or backlog issues.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear there may be increased demand based on recent orders. This highlights the need for better coordination to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to better match projected demand. Therefore, I will order 50 units to prepare for potential demand spikes while maintaining a buffer in inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts with each other to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Previous communication history:
        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.
