Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 100, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 60, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: 0.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=60, confidence=0.85, rationale=Based on communications, a demand increase is expected. Ordering 60 units ensures we can meet demand and maintain buffer stock., risk_assessment=Potential risk of overstocking if demand does not materialize as expected, leading to higher holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=100, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10], llm_incoming=[10], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expects demand to increase to 50 units and the Wholesaler anticipates a rise to 40 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to prepare for a potential spike in orders. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 30 units to maintain a balanced inventory while minimizing holding costs. Collaboration on sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels is crucial to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly meeting to share demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor have all observed or expect an increase in demand, ranging from 30 to 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that the supply chain is anticipating a significant rise in demand. I will increase my production output to ensure we can meet these expectations. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 50 units to maintain a steady supply and avoid backlog. It's crucial that we align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for real-time demand forecasting and inventory updates.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory have noted potential demand increases ranging from 30 to 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate closely to manage these expectations. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 60 units to meet anticipated demand and ensure we have enough buffer stock. Let's align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand forecasting and inventory updates.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expects demand to rise to 50 units, aligning with the Distributor's and Factory's expectations of increased demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are likely to experience a significant demand spike. Therefore, I will place an order for 50 units to ensure we can meet potential demand while maintaining a manageable inventory level.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update system for demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance decision-making and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler expect demand to rise significantly to around 50 units. The Factory is also increasing production based on this forecast. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to manage this anticipated spike effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 30 units to ensure we have enough inventory to meet demands without overstocking. Collaboration on demand forecasts is crucial to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance supply chain stability.
- Factory: I hear that all agents are anticipating a demand increase to around 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our inventory levels are sufficient to meet this demand without creating excess stock. Therefore, I will increase production to keep my inventory steady and meet anticipated orders, while also seeking to avoid backlogs. Let's focus on aligning our production and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain effectively.
  Proposal: Let's set up a shared real-time platform for demand forecasting and inventory tracking, enabling better coordination.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Incoming shipments this round: [71]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer mentioned a steady demand increase to 10-11 units and plans to order 60 units. Wholesaler also noted similar patterns and plans to maintain order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand is indeed growing steadily. Therefore, I will adjust my order strategy to meet the expected demand while managing my backlog effectively. Let's work together to align our forecasts and ensure a smooth supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand data and order updates.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor have noted a steady demand increase, and plan to maintain or slightly adjust order quantities to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining stable orders can help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to manage my backlog and align with the supply chain demand trends.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 50]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I've noticed a consistent demand pattern with slight fluctuations. To minimize the bullwhip effect, I suggest we synchronize our order quantities based on a rolling average of recent demands. This approach could help maintain balanced inventories across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I'm focusing on maintaining a steady order flow to prevent inventory excess and shortages.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared method for forecasting demand, such as a moving average, to ensure stability.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 103 units with no backlog. I'm ordering 60 units to match expected demand.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 103, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 6, Profit: 30.00, Total Profit: -16.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.85, rationale=Using the rolling average of recent demands (9 units) and maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=Risk of underestimating future demand could lead to backlogs, while overestimating can increase holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=9, llm_inventory=103, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10, 11, 6], llm_incoming=[49], llm_last_order=60
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 103 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 17 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 55
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (17 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "To maintain stable operations and minimize costs, I need to ensure sufficient inventory to meet both current backlog and upcoming demand while avoiding excessive stock that incurs holding costs.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 105 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 71, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (105 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Additionally, let's continue to synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Increasing production to meet higher demand and manage backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Propose a weekly demand and inventory sharing session to maintain alignment and optimize the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 0 units with a backlog of 218 units. Recent demands were [110, 10, 110], and I'm planning to increase production output.
  Confidence: 0.85

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 167, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 45, Units sold: 7, Profit: 35.00, Total Profit: -64.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=45, confidence=0.85, rationale=Based on recent demand patterns and upstream discussions, a moderate increase in demand is anticipated. An order of 45 units ensures demand coverage and maintains buffer., risk_assessment=Underestimating demand could lead to stockouts; overestimating could incur high holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=40, llm_inventory=167, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 6, 7], llm_incoming=[44], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 167 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 6, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [44]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear both Retailer and Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand, which aligns with my observations of a recent uptick in orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be prepared for higher demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better align with this expected demand, while ensuring I'm not overstocking. Let's focus on sharing our demand forecasts regularly to synchronize actions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly demand forecast sharing session to ensure all parties are aligned.
- Factory: I hear all of you have observed a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher demand while avoiding overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my production to increase output and reduce backlog. Additionally, let's focus on synchronizing our order quantities and sharing demand forecasts more regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Propose a weekly demand and inventory sharing session to better align our strategies.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory have all noted a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should collectively prepare for higher demand while avoiding excessive inventory. Therefore, I will slightly increase my order quantity to 65 units to ensure we meet consumer demand without overstocking. Let's keep our communication open to adapt efficiently.
  Proposal: I propose we continue sharing demand forecasts weekly to ensure alignment and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer plans to slightly increase their orders to meet anticipated demand and Distributor aligns with this trend, facing a backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand may indeed rise, but careful management is crucial to avoid overstock. Therefore, I will adjust my order strategy to ensure I have enough inventory to meet potential increases while minimizing holding costs. Let's focus on consistent sharing of our demand forecasts to synchronize our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Propose a bi-weekly demand and inventory update call to align strategies and reduce risks.
- Distributor: I hear both Retailer and Wholesaler have noted a potential increase in demand and are making slight increases in their order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a moderate increase in demand while being cautious of overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 60 units to address my current backlog and align with the expected demand. It's crucial we continue sharing our demand forecasts to synchronize our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Propose a weekly demand and inventory sharing session to maintain alignment.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor are all noting a potential increase in demand and adjusting their order quantities accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must indeed prepare for this demand spike while managing our backlogs effectively. Therefore, I will increase our production capacity to meet the anticipated demand and reduce backlog. Additionally, let's continue to synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Propose a weekly demand and inventory sharing session to maintain alignment and optimize the supply chain.

  Proposal: Propose a bi-weekly demand and inventory update call to align strategies and reduce risks.
- Distributor: I hear both Retailer and Wholesaler have noted a potential increase in demand and are making slight increases in their order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a moderate increase in demand while being cautious of overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 60 units to address my current backlog and align with the expected demand. It's crucial we continue sharing our demand forecasts to synchronize our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Propose a weekly demand and inventory sharing session to maintain alignment.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor are all noting a potential increase in demand and adjusting their order quantities accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must indeed prepare for this demand spike while managing our backlogs effectively. Therefore, I will increase our production capacity to meet the anticipated demand and reduce backlog. Additionally, let's continue to synchronize our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Propose a weekly demand and inventory sharing session to maintain alignment and optimize the supply chain.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 218 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [110, 10, 110]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 103
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (218 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 205, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 65, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: -112.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=65, confidence=0.85, rationale=Maintain a strong inventory to meet rising demand while minimizing holding costs., risk_assessment=Risk of underestimating demand leading to backlogs; overestimation could increase holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=205, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[6, 7, 11], llm_incoming=[56], llm_last_order=45
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 205 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [56]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 20 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler have both observed an increase in demand and are planning to adjust their strategies accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we might see a continued rise in demand across the supply chain. Therefore, I will increase my order quantity to ensure I can meet potential demand surges and reduce backlog. However, it is crucial we coordinate effectively to avoid amplifying the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I support the idea of a shared real-time dashboard for demand forecasts and inventory updates to improve visibility and coordination among us.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor have all noted increasing demand and are adjusting their strategies accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand is indeed rising across the supply chain, which may lead to increased backlogs if not managed carefully. Therefore, I will increase my order quantity to address potential demand surges while maintaining a balance to avoid excess inventory. It's crucial we coordinate to reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Distributor",

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 300 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 110, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 328
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (300 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 242, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 65, Units sold: 7, Profit: 35.00, Total Profit: -198.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=65, confidence=0.85, rationale=To avoid stockouts, maintain a buffer for rising demand as noted by all parties, but avoid overstocking., risk_assessment=Underestimating demand increases backlog risk, while overestimating increases holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=242, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[7, 11, 7], llm_incoming=[72], llm_last_order=65
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 242 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [72]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 65
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both mentioned a slight increase in demand and propose weekly check-ins for better coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand may continue to rise, but we should be cautious of over-ordering to avoid excess inventory costs. Therefore, I will adjust my strategy to order moderately while closely monitoring trends to meet demand effectively.
  Proposal: I support the idea of weekly check-ins. Let's establish a shared dashboard for real-time updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor have all noted a slight increase in demand and propose weekly check-ins for better alignment. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining communication will be vital in managing demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will collaborate on the proposed weekly check-ins to share updates on production capacity and inventory status to support a balanced supply chain.
  Proposal: I support weekly check-ins and suggest we create a shared forecasting tool for real-time demand and inventory updates.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor mentioned a trend of increasing demand and support the idea of weekly check-ins for better coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to stay alert to demand changes and maintain steady inventory levels. Therefore, I will continue placing consistent orders while monitoring demand closely to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's implement a shared dashboard for real-time demand and inventory updates to enhance coordination.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a slight increase in orders and suggests weekly check-ins for better coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should expect continued demand growth, and it's crucial to align our orders closely. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity to ensure we meet expected demand without excessive inventory. I've observed a recent demand trend averaging around 8 units per week, which supports the need for careful coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I agree with the Retailer's proposal for weekly check-ins. Let's formalize a communication schedule to discuss demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler have noted a trend of increasing demand and support weekly check-ins for better alignment. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand could continue to rise, and we must be cautious not to over-order to avoid excess inventory.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 143 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [44, 56, 72]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [328]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 175
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (143 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 247 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [110, 50, 100]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 450
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (247 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both mentioned a slight increase in demand and propose weekly check-ins for better coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand may continue to rise, but we should be cautious of over-ordering to avoid excess inventory costs. Therefore, I will adjust my strategy to order moderately while closely monitoring trends to meet demand effectively.
  Proposal: I support the idea of weekly check-ins. Let's establish a shared dashboard for real-time updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor have all noted a slight increase in demand and propose weekly check-ins for better alignment.

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [56, 50, 103, 450]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I've noticed a consistent demand averaging around 9 units over the past few rounds. To mitigate the bullwhip effect, I suggest coordinating our orders and sharing demand forecasts.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining steady orders to balance supply and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand and inventory updates.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 289 units with no backlog; expected demand next round is 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand averaging around 9 units and suggested coordinating orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our forecasts can stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my projection of an expected demand of 40 units next round and suggest we establish a shared platform for real-time updates.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning forecasts with demand trends to stabilize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's create a shared platform for updating demand forecasts and inventory levels in real-time.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 34 units with no backlog; expected demand next round is 40 units.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand averaging around 9 units and suggested coordinating orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. I also hear the Wholesaler's projection of an expected demand of 40 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our demand forecasts and share inventory status to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that my expected demand for the next round is 30 units, and propose a shared platform for real-time updates.
  Strategy Hint: Synchronize forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand forecasting and inventory updates.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 289 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [74]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 65
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 164 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [56, 72, 74]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [450]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 200
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (164 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand averaging around 9 units and suggested coordinating orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. I also hear the Wholesaler's projection of an expected demand of 40 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our demand forecasts and share inventory status to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that my expected demand for the next round is 30 units, and propose a shared platform for real-time updates.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand forecasting and inventory updates.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer noted a consistent demand of 9 units and suggested coordinating orders. I also hear the Wholesaler's expected demand of 40 units and Distributor's 30 units.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer expects a demand of 50 units next round and the Wholesaler plans to maintain an order quantity of 50 units. The Factory aims to produce 120 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that our demand forecasts are slightly optimistic, and we should aim for more accurate alignment to avoid surplus. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to 50 units to better balance supply and demand and reduce my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's finalize a shared real-time platform for demand and inventory updates for better synchronization.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expects a demand of 50 units, and the Distributor is planning to adjust their order to 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our production and order quantities closely with actual demand forecasts is crucial to minimizing backlogs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my production plan of 120 units to address both current backlog and expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's finalize the shared platform for real-time demand and inventory updates to ensure synchronized operations.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 100 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [50, 100, 103]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 500
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (100 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler are maintaining steady orders, slightly above expected demand, and the Factory plans to increase orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand might stabilize with a slight increase. Therefore, I will continue maintaining a buffer inventory to handle fluctuations, while being cautious of overstocking.
  Strategy Hint: I'm optimizing my buffer inventory to manage demand fluctuations effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard for real-time updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels.
  Information Shared: Recent demand varied between 54 and 74 units. My current inventory is 60 units with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear that Retailer is maintaining steady orders slightly above expected demand, Wholesaler is balancing inventory stability with readiness for demand increases, and Distributor is optimizing buffer inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that while demand might see a slight increase, we need to avoid overproduction to prevent excess inventory. Therefore, I will order conservatively while focusing on clearing the backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I am prioritizing backlog reduction and inventory stabilization.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard for real-time updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels.
  Information Shared: I currently have a backlog of 88 units and plan to order conservatively to manage potential demand increases.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 352 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 45
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer expects demand around 50 units and is focused on balancing inventory costs with demand fulfillment. Wholesaler is preparing for potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand might be higher in future rounds. Therefore, I will slightly increase my order quantities to ensure sufficient inventory. I've observed recent demand fluctuations between 54 and 74 units, so maintaining a buffer is crucial.
  Proposal: Let's establish a monthly demand forecast meeting to align our strategies and reduce the Bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expects demand around 50 units and aims to balance inventory costs with demand fulfillment. Wholesaler is keeping inventory stable while preparing for demand increases, and Distributor is slightly increasing orders to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we might see a moderate increase in demand in upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my strategy to ensure timely fulfillment of orders while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a bi-weekly meeting to share demand forecasts and align ordering strategies to reduce the Bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler is monitoring trends for potential demand increases, the Distributor is maintaining a buffer for demand fluctuations, and the Factory is planning to increase order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should carefully align our expectations to prevent overstock or shortages. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to balance inventory costs with demand fulfillment while being prepared for adjustments.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard to update weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels, improving alignment and reducing the Bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer is maintaining steady orders slightly above expected demand, and the Distributor is maintaining a buffer for demand fluctuations, while the Factory plans to increase orders to address potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand may rise moderately, but we must avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to stabilize inventory while preparing for potential demand shifts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard to update weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels, improving alignment and reducing the Bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler are maintaining steady orders, slightly above expected demand, and the Factory plans to increase orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand might stabilize with a slight increase. Therefore, I will continue maintaining a buffer inventory to handle fluctuations, while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard for real-time updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear that Retailer is maintaining steady orders slightly above expected demand, Wholesaler is balancing inventory stability with readiness for demand increases, and Distributor is optimizing buffer inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that while demand might see a slight increase, we need to avoid overproduction to prevent excess inventory. Therefore, I will order conservatively while focusing on clearing the backlog.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard for real-time updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [268]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer expects demand around 50 units and is focused on balancing inventory costs with demand fulfillment. Wholesaler is preparing for potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand might be higher in future rounds. Therefore, I will slightly increase my order quantities to ensure sufficient inventory. I've observed recent demand fluctuations between 54 and 74 units, so maintaining a buffer is crucial.
  Proposal: Let's establish a monthly demand forecast meeting to align our strategies and reduce the Bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer expects demand around 50 units and aims to balance inventory costs with demand fulfillment. Wholesaler is keeping inventory stable while preparing for demand increases, and Distributor is slightly increasing orders to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we might see a moderate increase in demand in upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my strategy to ensure timely fulfillment of orders while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's establish a bi-weekly meeting to share demand forecasts and align ordering strategies to reduce the Bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler is monitoring trends for potential demand increases, the Distributor is maintaining a buffer for demand fluctuations, and the Factory is planning to increase order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should carefully align our expectations to prevent overstock or shortages. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to balance inventory costs with demand fulfillment while being prepared for adjustments.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard to update weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels, improving alignment and reducing the Bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer is maintaining steady orders slightly above expected demand, and the Distributor is maintaining a buffer for demand fluctuations, while the Factory plans to increase orders to address potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand may rise moderately, but we must avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to stabilize inventory while preparing for potential demand shifts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard to update weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels, improving alignment and reducing the Bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler are maintaining steady orders, slightly above expected demand, and the Factory plans to increase orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand might stabilize with a slight increase. Therefore, I will continue maintaining a buffer inventory to handle fluctuations, while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard for real-time updates on demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear that Retailer is maintaining steady orders slightly above expected demand, Wholesaler is balancing inventory stability with readiness for demand increases, and Distributor is optimizing buffer inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that while demand might see a slight increase, we need to avoid overproduction to prevent excess inventory. Therefore, I will order conservatively while focusing on clearing the backlog.

- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler is monitoring trends for potential demand increases, the Distributor is maintaining a buffer for demand fluctuations, and the Factory is planning to increase order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should carefully align our expectations to prevent overstock or shortages. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to balance inventory costs with demand fulfillment while being prepared for adjustments.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital dashboard to update weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels, improving alignment and reducing the Bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer is maintaining steady orders slightly above expected demand, and the Distributor is maintaining a buffer for demand fluctuations, while the Factory plans to increase orders to address potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand may rise moderately, but we must avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to stabilize inventory while preparing for potential demand shifts.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 419 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [67]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 116 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [117]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand pattern around 8 units per week and is concerned about overstocking. The Wholesaler also supports aligning orders with demand trends to minimize costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should collectively aim to match our orders more closely with actual demand patterns. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantities to better reflect expected demand while maintaining enough inventory to cover fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update system where we share demand data and inventory levels to synchronize our orders more effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor have noted a consistent demand pattern of around 8 units per week and have expressed concerns about overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should adjust our orders to reflect actual demand patterns more closely to minimize backlog and excess inventory. Therefore, I will focus on aligning my production with expected demand trends while maintaining flexibility to adapt to sudden changes.
  Proposal: Let's implement a bi-weekly update system to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, enhancing synchronization across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory have all emphasized aligning orders with actual demand trends to minimize costs and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should continue sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to enhance synchronization. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better match the expected demand of 50 units next round while maintaining a buffer to cover fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring more synchronized ordering across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer, Distributor, and Factory have all emphasized aligning orders with actual demand trends to minimize costs and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a balance between demand forecasting and order quantity is crucial to reduce costs and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to adjust my orders to better match the expected demand trend while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a bi-weekly review of demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance synchronization across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler highlighted the importance of aligning orders with actual demand trends to minimize costs and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders aligned with demand patterns is crucial. Therefore, I will adjust my order to reflect the expected demand while keeping a buffer to handle fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a routine sharing of demand forecasts and inventory levels weekly to ensure synchronization across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized aligning orders with actual demand trends to minimize costs and overstocking. Retailer also plans to adjust their order quantity to match expected demand of 50 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining synchronization with demand patterns is crucial for minimizing backlog and maximizing profit. Therefore, I will adjust my production to better align with the expected demand while ensuring flexibility to handle fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's implement a bi-weekly update system to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, enhancing synchronization across the supply chain.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 393 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [74, 54, 67]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [220]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 100
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand pattern around 8 units per week and is concerned about overstocking. The Wholesaler also supports aligning orders with demand trends to minimize costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should collectively aim to match our orders more closely with actual demand patterns. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantities to better reflect expected demand while maintaining enough inventory to cover fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update system where we share demand data and inventory levels to synchronize our orders more effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor have noted a consistent demand pattern of around 8 units per week and have expressed concerns about overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should adjust our orders to reflect actual demand patterns more closely to minimize backlog and excess inventory. Therefore, I will focus on aligning my production with expected demand trends while maintaining flexibility to adapt to sudden changes.
  Proposal: Let's implement a bi-weekly update system to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, enhancing synchronization across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory have all emphasized aligning orders with actual demand trends to minimize costs and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should continue sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to enhance synchronization. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better match the expected demand of 50 units next round while maintaining a buffer to cover fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring more synchronized ordering across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer, Distributor, and Factory have all emphasized aligning orders with actual demand trends to minimize costs and overstocking.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 458, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 45, Units sold: 15, Profit: 75.00, Total Profit: -757.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=45, confidence=0.85, rationale=To maintain stability and minimize costs, align ordering with recent demand trends and incoming shipments while preserving a buffer., risk_assessment=Underestimating demand could lead to backlogs, while overestimating could increase holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=31, llm_inventory=458, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 7, 15], llm_incoming=[40], llm_last_order=25
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 458 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "Maintain a steady flow of orders to avoid the Bullwhip effect and meet demand while keeping inventory costs low.",

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  Proposal: Let's continue sharing our expected demand forecasts and order quantities to refine our strategies and reduce variability.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor are all focused on maintaining steady inventory levels and aligning order strategies to reduce the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that continued alignment and transparency can enhance our collective supply chain stability. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 50 units based on expected demand trends and support our initiative for a shared platform for real-time updates.
  Proposal: Let's implement a shared platform for real-time demand and inventory updates to enhance coordination.

    LLM Update Output: {}
    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 22 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [268, 117, 80]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 235
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (22 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 100,
          "backlog": 0,
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,
          "rationale": "<brief explanation of your reasoning>",
          "risk_assessment": "<describe any risks you anticipate>",
          "expected_demand_next_round": <integer>,
          "order_quantity": <integer>
        }

        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no markdown, no triple backticks, no code fences, and do NOT write the word 'json' anywhere. Your reply must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else. If you include anything else, your answer will be rejected. KEEP IT RATHER SHORT
