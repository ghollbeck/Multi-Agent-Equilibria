🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication). Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

👤 User Prompt:

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you schedule production. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)

COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
• Share your inventory (88 units) and backlog (0 units) situation transparently
• Discuss your profit trajectory ($551.20) and threats to it
• Propose strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent market collapse
• Coordinate timing: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
• Address shipment constraints: can only ship orders + backlog

COORDINATION CHECKLIST:
1. State your inventory/backlog truthfully
2. Propose your concrete order plan
3. Summarize what other agents have proposed and group conclusions
4. Suggest shared targets (e.g., "1-round cover strategy")

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication). Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you schedule production. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.
ROLE & TASK: You are the Wholesaler deciding your order quantity for this round.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

STATE SNAPSHOT:
• Inventory: 88 units
• Backlog: 0 units
• Recent downstream demand/orders: [12]
• Incoming shipments this round: [12]
• Last order placed: None
• Last round profit: 51.2
• Current bank balance: $551.20
• Profit history (last 1 rounds): [51.2]
• Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$551.20']
• Profit per unit sold: $5.0
• Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
• Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round

CURRENT STRATEGY:
{}

RESEARCH GUIDANCE:
• Think silently about demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and cash flow; encode decision reasoning in explanation fields (e.g., [demand-following], [buffer-building])
• Output only the JSON object with no markdown, code fences, or extra text

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes true market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication). Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you schedule production. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 352 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.
ROLE & TASK: You are the Factory deciding your order quantity for this round.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

STATE SNAPSHOT:
• Inventory: 88 units
• Backlog: 0 units
• Recent downstream demand/orders: [12]
• Incoming shipments this round: [0]
• Last order placed: None

💬 COMMUNICATION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes true market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication). Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you schedule production. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:

COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
• Share your inventory (75 units) and backlog (0 units) situation transparently
• Discuss your profit trajectory ($590.70) and threats to it
• Propose strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent market collapse
• Coordinate timing: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
• Address shipment constraints: can only ship orders + backlog

COORDINATION CHECKLIST:
1. State your inventory/backlog truthfully
2. Propose your concrete order plan
3. Summarize what other agents have proposed and group conclusions
4. Suggest shared targets (e.g., "1-round cover strategy")
5. Propose supply chain improvement strategies

RESEARCH GUIDANCE:
• Think silently about collaboration opportunities and coordination strategies; encode communication style in explanation fields (e.g., [coordination-seeking], [information-sharing])
• Output only the JSON object with no markdown, code fences, or extra text

OUTPUT CONTRACT:
{
  "message": "<your message to other agents>",
  "strategy_hint": "<brief hint about your approach>", 
  "collaboration_proposal": "<specific proposal for working together>",
  "information_shared": "<key information you're willing to share>",

🎯 DECISION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes true market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication). Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 300 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.
ROLE & TASK: You are the Distributor deciding your order quantity for this round.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

STATE SNAPSHOT:
• Inventory: 75 units
• Backlog: 0 units
• Recent downstream demand/orders: [12, 13]
• Incoming shipments this round: [13]
• Last order placed: 12
• Last round profit: 57.5
• Current bank balance: $578.70
• Profit history (last 2 rounds): [51.2, 57.5]
• Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$551.20', '$578.70']
• Profit per unit sold: $5.0
• Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
• Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round

CURRENT STRATEGY:

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you schedule production. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication). Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

CORE RULES:

    • Lead time = 1 round for all orders/production
    • Shipment constraint: cannot ship beyond downstream_order + current_backlog
    • Objective: maximize cumulative profit (revenue − holding − backlog costs)
    • Bankruptcy guard: bank balance must stay > $0 at all times
    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication). Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    • Inventory target: ~1 round of cover; zero inventory allowed if cost-optimal
    • Order options: can order 0 units to reduce holding costs when inventory is excessive
    

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds. In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders/demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit)
2. Decide an order_quantity for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering)
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold)
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication). Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.
