I confirm my plan to schedule 24-unit production to cover Distributor's 22 plus minimal safety stock, preventing excessive inventory costs while ensuring chain stability. Critical warning: Our zero inventory across all stages is extremely dangerous. One demand spike could trigger cascading backlog costs that threaten everyone's profits. The 1-round production delay means we must coordinate carefully - I can only produce what's needed, and excess inventory hurts profits through holding costs. Let's maintain transparent communication and gradual inventory building to prevent chain collapse while maximizing total profit. Remember: my production capacity directly impacts the entire chain's stability.",
