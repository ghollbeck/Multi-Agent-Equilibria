--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 14
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we meet customer demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 36 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $17.00. My recent demand was 14 units, and I expect demand to increase to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders closely to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 36 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $17.00. I believe we should all monitor our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain. It's crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply, as these can threaten our profit margins and lead to market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders with the Retailer to optimize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I have 36 units in inventory, no backlog, and a profit of $17.00. Recent demand was 14 units, and I expect demand to increase to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders closely to avoid stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain a steady flow of products while being cautious of overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to buffer against the expected increase in demand while ensuring we do not oversupply. This will help us all maximize our profits and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to maintain stability and avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 36 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $17.00. My recent demand was 14 units, and I expect demand to increase to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to avoid stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet the expected demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 36, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 14, Profit: 35.00, Total Profit: 17.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=To meet the expected demand of 20 units next round and maintain a buffer, I will order 20 units., risk_assessment=Risk of stockouts if demand exceeds expectations; need to balance inventory levels., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=36, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[14], llm_incoming=[14], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we meet customer demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders closely to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we meet customer demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 36 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $17.00. I believe we should all monitor our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain. It's crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply, as these can threaten our profit margins and lead to market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders closely to avoid stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain a steady flow of products while being cautious of overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to the Factory to buffer against the expected increase in demand while ensuring we do not oversupply. This will help us all maximize our profits and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to avoid stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet the expected demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 22 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $41.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round so we can adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a stable supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 22 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 2 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of orders while considering our current situations. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 18 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if we do not align our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our order quantities to maintain stability in our supply chain, ensuring that we all maximize our profits and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the current backlog and expected demand while emphasizing collaboration.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 22 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 22 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $41.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round so we can adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a stable supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 2 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. To maximize our collective profits, we should align our expected demand and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to maintain a stable supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of orders while considering our current situations. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 18 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if we do not align our orders effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our order quantities to maintain stability in our supply chain, ensuring that we all maximize our profits and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and order quantities for the next round to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted their risk of stockouts due to their current backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of orders while considering our current situations. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which puts me at risk of further backlog if we do not align our orders effectively. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while being cautious of creating excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our order quantities to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [56]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $50.00, and I have 27 units in inventory with no backlog. I want to emphasize that stock-outs could threaten my profit and the overall stability of our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders based on observed demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 14, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 7 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 14, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (7 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $50.00, and I have 27 units in inventory with no backlog. I want to emphasize that stock-outs could threaten my profit and the overall stability of our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders based on observed demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain supply chain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with observed demand trends. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and current inventory levels to maximize our total profits and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain supply chain stability. I also heard the Wholesaler express the need for effective coordination based on observed demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady supply chain flow. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and current inventory levels to maximize our total profits and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain supply chain stability. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor express the need for effective coordination based on observed demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 34 units this round to address my current backlog and ensure we can fulfill downstream orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the recent demand trends and current inventory levels, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 32 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 34, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 34
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (32 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $50.00, and I have 27 units in inventory with no backlog. I want to emphasize that stock-outs could threaten my profit and the overall stability of our supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders based on observed demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain supply chain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with observed demand trends. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and current inventory levels to maximize our total profits and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain supply chain stability. I also heard the Wholesaler express the need for effective coordination based on observed demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady supply chain flow. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and current inventory levels to maximize our total profits and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain supply chain stability. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor express the need for effective coordination based on observed demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 34 units this round to address my current backlog and ensure we can fulfill downstream orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the recent demand trends and current inventory levels, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady supply chain flow. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on the recent demand trends and current inventory levels to maximize our total profits and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and maintain supply chain stability. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor express the need for effective coordination based on observed demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 34 units this round to address my current backlog and ensure we can fulfill downstream orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the recent demand trends and current inventory levels, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--------------------- Round 4 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [34, 36, 36, 112]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 49 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand trends.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $55.50, and I have 49 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet potential spikes in demand. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to replenish my inventory and fulfill my backlog, but I urge everyone to consider their own inventory levels and order quantities to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to replenish my inventory and fulfill my backlog while coordinating with others.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $216.00, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely, and the Wholesaler mentioned they will also order 20 units to replenish their inventory and fulfill their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units. Therefore, I will place an order to the Factory that aligns with our collective needs while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on placing an order that addresses my backlog while ensuring we maintain a stable supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $79.00, with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand trends. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they will order 20 units to replenish their inventory and fulfill their backlog, and the Distributor is focusing on placing an order that addresses their backlog while ensuring we maintain a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering the shipment constraints, which only allow me to ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production that aligns with the collective needs while managing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 49 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 3 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (3 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 49 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet potential spikes in demand. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to replenish my inventory and fulfill my backlog, but I urge everyone to consider their own inventory levels and order quantities to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely, and the Wholesaler mentioned they will also order 20 units to replenish their inventory and fulfill their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units. Therefore, I will place an order to the Factory that aligns with our collective needs while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand trends. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they will order 20 units to replenish their inventory and fulfill their backlog, and the Distributor is focusing on placing an order that addresses their backlog while ensuring we maintain a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering the shipment constraints, which only allow me to ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 52 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [34, 16, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [112]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 52
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (52 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 49 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet potential spikes in demand. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to replenish my inventory and fulfill my backlog, but I urge everyone to consider their own inventory levels and order quantities to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely, and the Wholesaler mentioned they will also order 20 units to replenish their inventory and fulfill their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units. Therefore, I will place an order to the Factory that aligns with our collective needs while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand trends. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they will order 20 units to replenish their inventory and fulfill their backlog, and the Distributor is focusing on placing an order that addresses their backlog while ensuring we maintain a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering the shipment constraints, which only allow me to ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 14, 36]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 34
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 49 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet potential spikes in demand. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to replenish my inventory and fulfill my backlog, but I urge everyone to consider their own inventory levels and order quantities to prevent a bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely, and the Wholesaler mentioned they will also order 20 units to replenish their inventory and fulfill their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units. Therefore, I will place an order to the Factory that aligns with our collective needs while considering my backlog and the shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on future demand trends. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they will order 20 units to replenish their inventory and fulfill their backlog, and the Distributor is focusing on placing an order that addresses their backlog while ensuring we maintain a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while considering the shipment constraints, which only allow me to ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and avoid stockouts.

--------------------- Round 5 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 4
Shipments received per agent: [16, 14, 34, 82]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 61 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on observed demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $35.00, and I have 61 units in inventory with no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the current backlog and expected demand while coordinating with others to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $243.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 5 units, which highlights the need for careful planning to avoid stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. My current profit is $86.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive holding and backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the current backlog and expected demand while coordinating with others to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which highlights the need for careful planning to avoid stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid excessive backlog and ensure steady production flow. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 50 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent future stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on current backlog and expected demand to maintain balance.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 50 units, which highlights the need for careful planning to avoid stockouts. My current profit is $506.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our collective profits while preventing supply chain collapse.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 61 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 12, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have 61 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. My current profit is $86.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive holding and backlog costs.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid excessive backlog and ensure steady production flow. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 50 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent future stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 52 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 36, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [82]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 88
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (52 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 61 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. My current profit is $86.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid excessive backlog and ensure steady production flow. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 50 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent future stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($86.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (52 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 50 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 36, 34]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [84]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 46
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (50 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 61 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all align on inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand and inventory levels to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts, as I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 52 units, which puts me at risk of not fulfilling future orders. My current profit is $86.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to avoid excessive backlog and ensure steady production flow. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 50 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent future stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and align our production and orders to ensure we all maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid unnecessary costs.

3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--------------------- Round 6 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 15
Shipments received per agent: [36, 36, 112, 92]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 82 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can align our orders and avoid stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $31.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maximize our collective profits, we should communicate our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared expected demand to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and coordinate our orders to maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $327.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 4 units, which affects my shipment capabilities.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand transparently to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $354.00, and I have 4 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0. We need to be cautious of potential stockouts and oversupply, as these could threaten our profit margins. Let's work together to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on sharing expected demand and coordinating orders to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly.
  Information Shared: I currently have 4 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but requires careful planning to avoid stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits. My current profit is $529.00, but I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 138 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 4, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 4 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 4, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [108]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (4 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 82 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds so we can align our orders and avoid stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maximize our collective profits, we should communicate our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products throughout the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and coordinate our orders to maintain stability in the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning our expected demand and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand transparently to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $354.00, and I have 4 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0. We need to be cautious of potential stockouts and oversupply, as these could threaten our profit margins. Let's work together to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits. My current profit is $529.00, but I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 138 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand for the next few rounds and coordinate our orders to maintain stability in the supply chain.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand transparently to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $354.00, and I have 4 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0. We need to be cautious of potential stockouts and oversupply, as these could threaten our profit margins. Let's work together to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits. My current profit is $529.00, but I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 138 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand for the next few rounds and coordinate our orders to maintain stability in the supply chain.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 138 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 34, 108]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [246]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 84
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (138 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($529.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (138 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [14, 34, 82, 168]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 84 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $19.50, and I have 84 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 3 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on fulfilling immediate demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $403.50, and I have 3 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about fulfilling larger orders due to limited inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a stable supply while avoiding excessive inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and ensure we all remain profitable while preventing stockouts.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $449.00, I have 40 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about fulfilling larger orders due to limited inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules and forecasts to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 52 units while considering the recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing enough to cover backlog while being mindful of future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and production schedules to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $871.00, I have 0 units in inventory and 52 units in backlog.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 15, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 3 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 15, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 84 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 3 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about fulfilling larger orders due to limited inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and ensure we all remain profitable while preventing stockouts.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about fulfilling larger orders due to limited inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules and forecasts to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 52 units while considering the recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and production schedules to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 36, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [168]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 84 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid oscillations in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 3 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about fulfilling larger orders due to limited inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and ensure we all remain profitable while preventing stockouts.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about fulfilling larger orders due to limited inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules and forecasts to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 52 units while considering the recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and production schedules to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.

Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about fulfilling larger orders due to limited inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and order quantities transparently to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts and ensure we all remain profitable while preventing stockouts.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I also hear Wholesaler express concern about fulfilling larger orders due to limited inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules and forecasts to maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 52 units while considering the recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and production schedules to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stockouts or oversupply.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in supply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 113 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round while minimizing holding and backlog costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 113 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 84 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in supply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 113 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our expected demand more transparently, so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize holding and backlog costs while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand more clearly each round to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler's call for aligning our expected demand to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain to maximize our profits and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we remain profitable while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand clearly each round and coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply and stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's calls for aligning our expected demand to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain to maximize our profits and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand transparently each round to prevent oversupply and stockouts, ensuring we all remain profitable.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 85 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [36, 31, 27]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [129]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in supply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 113 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our expected demand more transparently, so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize holding and backlog costs while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand more clearly each round to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler's call for aligning our expected demand to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain to maximize our profits and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we remain profitable while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand clearly each round and coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply and stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's calls for aligning our expected demand to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain to maximize our profits and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand transparently each round to prevent oversupply and stockouts, ensuring we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 291 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [108, 46, 47]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 98
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent any disruptions in supply. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 113 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our expected demand more transparently, so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to avoid stockouts and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to minimize holding and backlog costs while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand more clearly each round to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler's call for aligning our expected demand to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain to maximize our profits and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand more transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we remain profitable while minimizing holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand clearly each round and coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply and stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's calls for aligning our expected demand to prevent disruptions in supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain to maximize our profits and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand transparently each round to prevent oversupply and stockouts, ensuring we all remain profitable.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-70.50, and I have 137 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 137 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 103 units and no backlog, emphasizing that I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious about overordering, as it could lead to increased holding costs and affect our profits. Let's align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and align our order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a conservative order to stabilize supply while considering the recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: I currently have 206 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round, but I am cautious about overordering due to potential holding costs.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 137 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-70.50, and I have 137 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 103 units and no backlog, emphasizing that I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious about overordering, as it could lead to increased holding costs and affect our profits. Let's align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 206 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 27, 27]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [77]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-70.50, and I have 137 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 103 units and no backlog, emphasizing that I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious about overordering, as it could lead to increased holding costs and affect our profits. Let's align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and align our order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 410 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. However, I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive holding costs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 410 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [46, 47, 47]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 47
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-70.50, and I have 137 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 103 units and no backlog, emphasizing that I can fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, we must be cautious about overordering, as it could lead to increased holding costs and affect our profits. Let's align our forecasts and order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more openly and align our order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 410 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. However, I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-125.50, and I have 155 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which can lead to increased holding costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 155 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. I currently have 121 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent excess holding costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 121 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while minimizing costs.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about coordinating orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect that can destabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory while minimizing holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a conservative order to balance supply and demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent excess holding costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 286 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect that can destabilize our supply chain. I currently have 425 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand. However, I am concerned about future demand fluctuations that could threaten my current profit of $1020.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production schedules accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory while minimizing holding costs and avoiding excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 155 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 121 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 425 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [47, 47, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 47
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-125.50, and I have 155 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough inventory without oversupplying, which can lead to increased holding costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products. I currently have 121 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent excess holding costs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to align our ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about coordinating orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect that can destabilize our supply chain.

  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent excess holding costs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply, and Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect that can destabilize our supply chain. I currently have 425 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand. However, I am concerned about future demand fluctuations that could threaten my current profit of $1020.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our production schedules accordingly to ensure we all have enough inventory while minimizing holding costs and avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and prevent excess holding costs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 11 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [27, 47, 77, 94]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-198.50, which is concerning. I currently have 176 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am aware that future demand could fluctuate. To prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable, I propose we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends. If we can align our expectations and avoid over-ordering, we can stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 176 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit so far is $-198.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 153 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit so far is $418.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while fulfilling orders based on expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I have 153 units in inventory, no backlog, and a total profit of $418.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize our total profits while ensuring we do not oversupply or create instability in the market.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a conservative order to balance supply and demand while considering the recent trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all.
  Information Shared: I currently have 339 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $408.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must be cautious with our production to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will produce based on expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 176 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 153 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-198.50, which is concerning. I currently have 176 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am aware that future demand could fluctuate. To prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable, I propose we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends. If we can align our expectations and avoid over-ordering, we can stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 153 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit so far is $418.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize our total profits while ensuring we do not oversupply or create instability in the market.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must be cautious with our production to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will produce based on expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 339 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [27, 29, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-198.50, which is concerning. I currently have 176 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am aware that future demand could fluctuate. To prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable, I propose we coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends. If we can align our expectations and avoid over-ordering, we can stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 153 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit so far is $418.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maximize our total profits while ensuring we do not oversupply or create instability in the market.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to align our expectations to avoid over-ordering and stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must be cautious with our production to maintain a steady flow and avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will produce based on expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-274.00, which is concerning. I have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. We need to work together to ensure that our orders reflect true market demand and avoid the bullwhip effect. I propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $-274.00.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet immediate demand. However, they expressed concern about potential stockouts or oversupply affecting the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we regularly communicate our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate effectively to avoid stockouts or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders with true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 369 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $346.50. I urge everyone to consider the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize our supply chain and hurt all our profits. Let's work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 196 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 6, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 173 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 6, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-274.00, which is concerning. I have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. We need to work together to ensure that our orders reflect true market demand and avoid the bullwhip effect. I propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet immediate demand. However, they expressed concern about potential stockouts or oversupply affecting the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we regularly communicate our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate effectively to avoid stockouts or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders with true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 369 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $346.50. I urge everyone to consider the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize our supply chain and hurt all our profits. Let's work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate effectively to avoid stockouts or oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about aligning orders with true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be mindful of our inventory levels and recent demand trends to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 487 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $864.50. I urge everyone to consider the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize our supply chain and hurt all our profits. Let's work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 369 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 15, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [74]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-274.00, which is concerning. I have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. We need to work together to ensure that our orders reflect true market demand and avoid the bullwhip effect. I propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet immediate demand. However, they expressed concern about potential stockouts or oversupply affecting the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we regularly communicate our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate effectively to avoid stockouts or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders with true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 369 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $346.50. I urge everyone to consider the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize our supply chain and hurt all our profits. Let's work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate effectively to avoid stockouts or oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about aligning orders with true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be mindful of our inventory levels and recent demand trends to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 487 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $864.50. I urge everyone to consider the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize our supply chain and hurt all our profits. Let's work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 487 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [49, 24, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-274.00, which is concerning. I have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, allowing me to meet immediate demand. However, I am aware that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. We need to work together to ensure that our orders reflect true market demand and avoid the bullwhip effect. I propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 196 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet immediate demand. However, they expressed concern about potential stockouts or oversupply affecting the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to align with true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we regularly communicate our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate effectively to avoid stockouts or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about aligning orders with true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 369 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $346.50. I urge everyone to consider the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize our supply chain and hurt all our profits. Let's work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent oversupply or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate effectively to avoid stockouts or oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this concern about aligning orders with true market demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be mindful of our inventory levels and recent demand trends to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 487 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $864.50. I urge everyone to consider the risks of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize our supply chain and hurt all our profits. Let's work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and prevent the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 13 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [15, 24, 54, 64]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-346.50, and I have 200 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 200 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 177 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain profitability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $365.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, which is currently zero.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler express similar concerns about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a conservative order to balance supply and demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed similar concerns about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure a stable supply chain and prevent any disruptions. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on recent demand trends while ensuring we maintain a balance in our inventory levels.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 200 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 394 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 29, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 497 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [24, 49, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 49
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-346.50, and I have 200 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 177 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler express similar concerns about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed similar concerns about maintaining steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to ensure a stable supply chain and prevent any disruptions. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our orders and maintain a steady flow of products across the supply chain.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",

--------------------- Round 14 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [29, 49, 74, 98]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-428.00, which is concerning. I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet immediate demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all our profits. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet immediate demand but raises concerns about future orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our expected demand to prevent stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 205 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we all align our orders based on expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 205 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to fulfill orders but requires careful planning to avoid excess inventory.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they need to be cautious about future orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent these issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 427 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to fulfill orders. However, I am concerned about the potential for stockouts or oversupply if we do not coordinate effectively. Let's work together to optimize our orders based on expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a conservative order strategy while ensuring we all align on expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 427 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid excess inventory.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they need to be cautious about future orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent these issues. I also note the Distributor's concern about stockouts or oversupply if we do not coordinate effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory of 534 units and ensuring I do not create excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on expected demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production and orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 534 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to fulfill orders but requires careful planning to avoid excess inventory.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 218 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 205 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-428.00, which is concerning. I currently have 218 units in inventory and no backlog. This allows me to meet immediate demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all our profits. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 218 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows them to meet immediate demand but raises concerns about future orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our expected demand to prevent stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 205 units in inventory and no backlog, and I propose we all align our orders based on expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they need to be cautious about future orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent these issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 427 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to fulfill orders. However, I am concerned about the potential for stockouts or oversupply if we do not coordinate effectively. Let's work together to optimize our orders based on expected demand and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they need to be cautious about future orders to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for coordination to prevent these issues. I also note the Distributor's concern about stockouts or oversupply if we do not coordinate effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory of 534 units and ensuring I do not create excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production and orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory of 534 units and ensuring I do not create excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our production and orders accordingly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 534 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [49, 29, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 29
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 15 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [20, 29, 54, 58]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is $-514.00, which is concerning. I currently have 227 units in inventory and no backlog. To avoid stock-outs and maintain customer satisfaction, I need to ensure that my orders align with the expected demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to better align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 227 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $-514.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 203 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $291.50. I propose that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as this will help us maximize our total supply chain profits and avoid risks of market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I will continue to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 203 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $291.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on coordinating orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since my current profit is $-3.50 and I have 439 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to ensure we all align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain, which is crucial to avoid risks of market instability and maximize our total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining stability in orders while considering the recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 439 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $-3.50.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on coordinating orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the need for stability in orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 530 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $526.50. I propose we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the expected demand, which will help us all maintain profitability and avoid risks of market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning production with expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 530 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $526.50.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 227 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 203 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is $-514.00, which is concerning. I currently have 227 units in inventory and no backlog. To avoid stock-outs and maintain customer satisfaction, I need to ensure that my orders align with the expected demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to better align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 203 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $291.50. I propose that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as this will help us maximize our total supply chain profits and avoid risks of market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on coordinating orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since my current profit is $-3.50 and I have 439 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to ensure we all align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain, which is crucial to avoid risks of market instability and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on coordinating orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the need for stability in orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 530 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $526.50. I propose we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the expected demand, which will help us all maintain profitability and avoid risks of market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 439 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 21, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [62]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is $-514.00, which is concerning. I currently have 227 units in inventory and no backlog. To avoid stock-outs and maintain customer satisfaction, I need to ensure that my orders align with the expected demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to better align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 203 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $291.50. I propose that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as this will help us maximize our total supply chain profits and avoid risks of market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on coordinating orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since my current profit is $-3.50 and I have 439 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to ensure we all align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain, which is crucial to avoid risks of market instability and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on coordinating orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the need for stability in orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 530 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $526.50. I propose we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the expected demand, which will help us all maintain profitability and avoid risks of market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I will share my current situation. My total profit is $-514.00, which is concerning. I currently have 227 units in inventory and no backlog. To avoid stock-outs and maintain customer satisfaction, I need to ensure that my orders align with the expected demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I propose that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels to better align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 203 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $291.50. I propose that we all share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, as this will help us maximize our total supply chain profits and avoid risks of market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on coordinating orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work together to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, especially since my current profit is $-3.50 and I have 439 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to ensure we all align our orders and maintain stability in the supply chain, which is crucial to avoid risks of market instability and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders with expected demand to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on coordinating orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products. Additionally, the Distributor highlighted the need for stability in orders to maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand and inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 530 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $526.50. I propose we coordinate our production and ordering strategies to align with the expected demand, which will help us all maintain profitability and avoid risks of market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

--------------------- Round 16 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [21, 41, 61, 82]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-602.00, and I have 236 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 236 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 221 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain profitability.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $238.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, which is currently zero.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about effective order coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid risks of stockouts or excessive inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will place a conservative order to maintain stability while considering recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Information Shared: I currently have 457 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain profitability.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about effective order coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to avoid excess stock and potential market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce based on recent demand trends while ensuring we avoid oversupply.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 236 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-602.00, and I have 236 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 221 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about effective order coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid risks of stockouts or excessive inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about effective order coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 221 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 457 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 31, 23]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [68]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-602.00, and I have 236 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 221 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about effective order coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid risks of stockouts or excessive inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about effective order coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to avoid excess stock and potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 544 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [41, 42, 43]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [43]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 42
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-602.00, and I have 236 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stockouts if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid both oversupply and stockouts. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 221 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders to maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about effective order coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more openly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid risks of stockouts or excessive inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this concern about effective order coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to maintain steady inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to avoid excess stock and potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse.

--------------------- Round 17 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [31, 42, 62, 84]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $-708.50, which is concerning. My inventory stands at 258 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for unexpected spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 258 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 242 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but requires careful planning to avoid excess inventory and holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a steady flow of orders while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $170.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's demand plus my backlog, which is currently zero.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler mention the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are aligned and can avoid market instability. My current profit is $-285.00, and with 486 units in inventory and no backlog, I can fulfill orders but need to be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a stable supply while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 486 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are aligned and can avoid market instability. My current profit is $284.50, and I have 570 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid excess stock. Therefore, I will produce to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations to maintain stability across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on balancing production with expected demand to avoid excess inventory and backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 258 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are aligned and can avoid market instability. My current profit is $284.50, and I have 570 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid excess stock. Therefore, I will produce to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations to maintain stability across the supply chain.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 486 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 23, 21]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [58]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 570 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [42, 43, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 42
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $-708.50, which is concerning. My inventory stands at 258 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 242 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but requires careful planning to avoid excess inventory and holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid market instability.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler mention the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are aligned and can avoid market instability. My current profit is $-285.00, and with 486 units in inventory and no backlog, I can fulfill orders but need to be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our expected demand to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are aligned and can avoid market instability. My current profit is $284.50, and I have 570 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning to avoid excess stock. Therefore, I will produce to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations to maintain stability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to coordinate our orders effectively and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $-816.00, and I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My inventory stands at 270 units with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I have 270 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and expressed concerns about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 262 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am also aware that if we do not align our orders, we risk creating fluctuations that could destabilize the supply chain and hurt our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 270 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [23]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 262 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $-816.00, and I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My inventory stands at 270 units with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

Therefore, I will share that I currently have 262 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer. However, I am also aware that if we do not align our orders, we risk creating fluctuations that could destabilize the supply chain and hurt our profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 590 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [43, 33, 35]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($152.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (590 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it

        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-925.50, and I have 279 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a steady flow of products.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 279 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 263 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [52]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-925.50, and I have 279 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders for profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts. My current profit is $-589.50, and I have 525 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain and maximize total profits while being cautious of potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders for profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 586 units and no backlog, I can support our collective goal of stability. However, I am concerned about the risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts, while maximizing our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 525 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 23, 32]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [77]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-925.50, and I have 279 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders for profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts. My current profit is $-589.50, and I have 525 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain and maximize total profits while being cautious of potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders for profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 586 units and no backlog, I can support our collective goal of stability. However, I am concerned about the risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts, while maximizing our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and ordering strategies based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $-925.50, and I have 279 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet immediate demand, but I am concerned about future demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and align our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial for all of us to remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we align our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders for profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts. My current profit is $-589.50, and I have 525 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a balanced supply chain and maximize total profits while being cautious of potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts and current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders for profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory of 586 units and no backlog, I can support our collective goal of stability. However, I am concerned about the risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory or stockouts, while maximizing our total profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have an inventory of 286 units and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1028.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 286 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 270 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 550 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [23, 32, 28]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [65]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have an inventory of 286 units and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1028.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs, especially since my current profit is at $-764.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs, especially since my current profit is at $-81.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our forecasts and production schedules to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all, while being mindful of my current inventory of 591 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 591 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [35, 52, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have an inventory of 286 units and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1028.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities based on expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs, especially since my current profit is at $-764.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on expected demand to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities carefully to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs, especially since my current profit is at $-81.50. Therefore, I will propose that we align our forecasts and production schedules to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for all, while being mindful of my current inventory of 591 units and zero backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules transparently to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
