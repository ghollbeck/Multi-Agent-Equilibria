Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 99, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 60, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=60, confidence=0.9, rationale=With all partners expecting increased demand, maintaining a 60-unit order supports anticipated needs while balancing inventory., risk_assessment=The primary risk is a demand surge beyond expectations, potentially increasing backlog costs., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=99, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Update Output: {}
    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 96 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler have noted a steady increase in demand and the need for balanced inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that synchronizing our demand forecasts can help us manage inventory effectively. Therefore, I will focus on aligning my order quantities with anticipated demand to minimize backlog.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for real-time demand forecasting and order synchronization to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer mentioned a steady increase in demand, and both Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized aligning demand forecasts to manage inventory levels effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that cooperation in demand forecasting is crucial to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to align with the expected demand of 50 units next round, while considering past fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to coordinate better and reduce inefficiencies.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory have all emphasized the importance of aligning demand forecasts to manage inventory levels effectively.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 97 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [47]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 23 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (23 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With an initial inventory of 100 units and no backlog, I aim to balance meeting demand and minimizing holding costs. Ordering moderately helps mitigate backlog risks without causing excess inventory.",

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 80 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 73, 47]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 54
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (80 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 154, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 70, Units sold: 16, Profit: 80.00, Total Profit: 27.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=70, confidence=0.9, rationale=Considering the recent demand trend and communication focus on maintaining higher inventory, I anticipate a demand of around 40 units. Ordering a bit more will help cover unexpected surges., risk_assessment=The risk of demand surge may lead to stockouts if inventory is not sufficient.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 154 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [89]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Last order placed: 34
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 194 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [109, 11, 109]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 130
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (194 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 189, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 75, Units sold: 12, Profit: 60.00, Total Profit: -7.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=75, confidence=0.9, rationale=Based on recent demand and communication with partners, we expect a slight increase in demand.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 189 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 16, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 70
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 51 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 16, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 27
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (51 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a stable demand pattern and the Wholesaler expressed concerns about demand surges. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to focus on accurate demand forecasting to reduce backlog and inventory costs. Therefore, I will maintain a cautious order quantity while addressing my current backlog. Let's set up a weekly call to refine our demand forecasts and align our ordering strategies.
  Proposal: Establishing a weekly demand forecast call to synchronize our supply chain strategies.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer has a stable demand pattern, and both the Wholesaler and Distributor are concerned about demand surges and backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prioritize accurate demand forecasting and alignment in order placements. Therefore, I will adjust my order strategy to address my current backlog and expected demand, while maintaining a buffer stock to minimize stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared dashboard to monitor demand trends and inventory levels across the supply chain, and hold a weekly call to synchronize our strategies.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor are both focusing on demand surges and backlog management, which aligns with my focus on balancing inventory and demand fulfillment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prioritize accurate demand forecasting and synchronized order strategies. Therefore, I will maintain a high inventory level to manage expected demand surges and coordinate closely with you all to refine our forecasts.
  Proposal: Let's implement a shared dashboard for real-time demand and inventory tracking, and hold a weekly call to synchronize our strategies.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer is maintaining a high inventory to manage demand surges, and both the Distributor and Factory emphasize accurate demand forecasting to address backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our demand forecasts and order strategies. Therefore, I will continue ordering 30 units to manage my current backlog while anticipating potential demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared dashboard for real-time demand and inventory tracking, and hold weekly calls to synchronize our strategies, reducing the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer is focused on maintaining high inventory to handle demand surges, and the Wholesaler is balancing backlog management with preparedness for demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need a coordinated approach to manage inventory levels and demand forecasting across the supply chain. Therefore, I will adjust my order strategy to address my backlog and potential demand surges, and I recommend we set up a shared platform for real-time updates.
  Proposal: Let's implement a shared dashboard for real-time demand and inventory tracking, alongside weekly calls to align our strategies.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer is focused on maintaining high inventory levels to manage demand surges, and both the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need for accurate demand forecasting to address backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that a coordinated effort is crucial to balance our supply chain dynamics effectively. Therefore, I will adjust my order strategy to better align with anticipated demand while addressing my backlog, and propose a shared dashboard to monitor real-time demand and inventory levels.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 278 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 109, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 316
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (278 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Shipments received per agent: [89, 109, 110, 316]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: Hello team, I've noticed a steady demand pattern over the last few rounds, with recent orders at 16, 12, and 10 units. My inventory is currently stable at 268 units with no backlog. To maintain this balance, I'll continue to order in moderation while monitoring demand closely.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on balancing inventory levels to avoid unnecessary costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels and expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 268 units with no backlog, and I expect demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer mentioned a steady demand pattern with recent orders of 16, 12, and 10 units. With my inventory at 0 and a backlog of 27, I am adjusting my strategy to prioritize clearing backlog while being cautious with new orders. The steady demand suggests a potential increase in future orders, and I plan to adjust my order accordingly. Sharing more precise demand forecasts could help us optimize our inventory further.
  Strategy Hint: Prioritize clearing backlog to stabilize supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize expected demand forecasts and inventory levels to fine-tune our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.

Based on this, my conclusion is that demand fluctuations are a concern, and we need to ensure consistent supply. Therefore, I will adjust my order size to meet anticipated demand while managing backlog effectively.
  Strategy Hint: Align order sizes with anticipated demand to manage backlog while maintaining supply.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared demand forecasting tool to synchronize our order sizes and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 0 units, backlog is 230 units, recent demands were 109, 50, and 110 units.
  Confidence: 0.78
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear Wholesaler is focusing on clearing backlog and expects demand of 30 units, while Distributor is aligning orders more closely with demand. Factory is concerned about demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for better demand forecasts. Therefore, I will continue to order cautiously to manage my inventory and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain moderate orders to balance inventory and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared forecasting system to improve demand accuracy and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 268 units with no backlog; I expect demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer maintains a stable inventory with expected demand of 50 units, while Distributor and Factory focus on aligning orders with demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that our shared goal is to manage backlog and inventory efficiently.

Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize stable inventory and backlog clearance, while Factory highlights demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that precise demand forecasts are crucial for reducing backlog and improving supply chain stability. Therefore, I will focus on aligning my order with expected demand and propose we use a shared forecasting tool.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders closely with expected demand to manage backlog efficiently.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's implement a shared demand forecasting tool to synchronize our order sizes and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory is 0 with a backlog of 165 units. Recent demands were 89, 31, and 109 units, expecting 40 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.72
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear Retailer expects stable demand and Wholesaler and Distributor are focusing on backlog clearance and precise demand alignment. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the demand appears stable, fluctuations are still a risk. Therefore, I will adjust my orders to manage backlog while maintaining flexibility to accommodate any sudden demand increases. I suggest we enhance our demand sharing practices to ensure all are prepared for potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Adjust orders to manage backlog while maintaining flexibility for demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared real-time demand tracking system to improve our response to actual demand changes.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 268, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 60, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -91.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=60, confidence=0.8, rationale=Maintaining a buffer to cover expected demand while minimizing holding costs and avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Potential for higher than expected demand could deplete inventory rapidly, leading to stockouts., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=268, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[16, 12, 10], llm_incoming=[109], llm_last_order=75
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 268 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 12, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [109]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 75
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 165 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [89, 31, 109]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [316]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 158
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (165 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 230 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [109, 50, 110]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 338
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (230 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer has a stable inventory with no backlog, and Wholesaler is prioritizing backlog clearance. I am currently at 0 inventory with a significant backlog of 165 units, and I notice a fluctuating demand with recent orders of 89, 31, and 109 units. Based on this, my conclusion is we need to align our order sizes more closely to actual demand to reduce backlogs and inventory costs. Therefore, I will focus on precise demand forecasting and propose a collaborative approach to share more accurate demand insights.
  Proposal: Let's set up a shared document to update and align on expected demand and inventory levels before each round.
- Factory: I hear Retailer has a stable inventory and expects demand of 50 units, Wholesaler is focused on backlog clearance with expected demand of 30 units, and Distributor suggests we align orders with actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that demand fluctuations are a concern, and we need to ensure consistent supply. Therefore, I will adjust my order size to meet anticipated demand while managing backlog effectively.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared demand forecasting tool to synchronize our order sizes and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler is focusing on clearing backlog and expects demand of 30 units, while Distributor is aligning orders more closely with demand. Factory is concerned about demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for better demand forecasts. Therefore, I will continue to order cautiously to manage my inventory and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared forecasting system to improve demand accuracy and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer maintains a stable inventory with expected demand of 50 units, while Distributor and Factory focus on aligning orders with demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that our shared goal is to manage backlog and inventory efficiently. Therefore, I will prioritize clearing my backlog and order cautiously to stabilize our supply chain. I suggest we focus on sharing precise demand forecasts to better align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's establish a real-time demand forecasting tool to align our order quantities and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler emphasize stable inventory and backlog clearance, while Factory highlights demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that precise demand forecasts are crucial for reducing backlog and improving supply chain stability. Therefore, I will focus on aligning my order with expected demand and propose we use a shared forecasting tool.
  Proposal: Let's implement a shared demand forecasting tool to synchronize our order sizes and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer expects stable demand and Wholesaler and Distributor are focusing on backlog clearance and precise demand alignment. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the demand appears stable, fluctuations are still a risk. Therefore, I will adjust my orders to manage backlog while maintaining flexibility to accommodate any sudden demand increases. I suggest we enhance our demand sharing practices to ensure all are prepared for potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared real-time demand tracking system to improve our response to actual demand changes.

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [31, 50, 130, 338]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: Hello team, I've noticed a steady demand pattern with recent orders being fairly consistent at around 11 units on average. I'm maintaining a high inventory to ensure I can meet demand and avoid backlogs. I recommend we all share our inventory levels and expected demand to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Balancing inventory to meet demand without overstocking.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular update on inventory and demand forecasts to improve our coordination.
  Information Shared: I've observed a consistent demand around 11 units and maintain a high inventory to prevent stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand average of 11 units and a strategy to maintain high inventory to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should aim for a balanced approach to satisfy demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will focus on ordering enough to cover the current backlog and anticipated demand. I suggest we all share our expected demand forecasts to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Balancing orders to address backlog and expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared platform for updating demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly.
  Information Shared: Current backlog is 48 units with an anticipated demand of 30 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of 11 units and Wholesaler spoke about aiming to address backlog and expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our inventory levels and order quantities. Therefore, I will focus on clearing my backlog and anticipate a similar demand pattern. I've noticed a fluctuating demand with recent orders of 31, 109, and 50 units, which suggests volatility. Let's work together to share more accurate demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on reducing backlog while aligning orders with observed demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose a weekly update on our current inventory levels and expected demand to improve synchronization.
  Information Shared: Current backlog is 142 units with recent fluctuating orders of 31, 109, and 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.78
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear that Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of 11 units and a strategy to maintain high inventory, while Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized addressing backlogs and aligning with demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our order quantities with recent demand trends and backlogs is crucial. Therefore, I will focus on minimizing our backlog while preparing for potential demand surges. I suggest we establish a shared platform to update on inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Prioritize backlog reduction and prepare for demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's create a collaborative platform to update inventory and demand forecasts weekly.
  Information Shared: Currently facing a backlog of 158 units with recent fluctuating demand.
  Confidence: 0.82
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear Wholesaler mentioned a balanced approach to satisfy demand and Distributor noted fluctuating orders, which resonates with our observations of consistent demand around 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should maintain our current inventory strategy to handle potential surges while reducing excess stock. Therefore, I will continue ordering to keep inventory at a level that minimizes both stockouts and excess costs.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain consistent inventory to handle stable demand and potential surges.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a weekly video call to share inventory levels and demand forecasts to fine-tune our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I've maintained a high inventory to meet consistent demand around 11 units, aiming to prevent stockouts.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining a high inventory to meet consistent demand, while the Distributor and Factory emphasized addressing backlogs and preparing for fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our forecasts and inventory levels more closely. Therefore, I will focus on clearing my backlog and ordering enough to cover anticipated demand, while working to improve information sharing.
  Strategy Hint: Address backlog and synchronize forecasts with partners.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital platform for real-time updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts.
  Information Shared: Current backlog is 48 units with an expected demand of 30 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear that Retailer and Wholesaler have both emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced inventory and addressing backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must prioritize backlog reduction and align our demand forecasts to handle volatility. Therefore, I will focus on ordering enough to clear my backlog while anticipating fluctuating demand. Let's work together to improve our demand forecasting and inventory updates.
  Strategy Hint: Prioritize backlog reduction while preparing for demand volatility.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital platform for real-time updates on inventory and demand forecasts.
  Information Shared: Current backlog is 142 units with recent demand fluctuations of 31, 109, and 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear that the Wholesaler emphasized addressing backlogs and synchronizing forecasts, and the Distributor focused on backlog reduction while preparing for volatility. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all collaborate closely to handle our significant backlogs and prepare for fluctuating demand. Therefore, I will focus on clearing my backlog and aligning our order quantities with recent demand trends. Let's work together to create a shared platform for real-time updates on inventory and demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 288 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of 11 units and Wholesaler spoke about aiming to address backlog and expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our inventory levels and order quantities. Therefore, I will focus on clearing my backlog and anticipate a similar demand pattern. I've noticed a fluctuating demand with recent orders of 31, 109, and 50 units, which suggests volatility. Let's work together to share more accurate demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose a weekly update on our current inventory levels and expected demand to improve synchronization.
- Factory: I hear that Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of 11 units and a strategy to maintain high inventory, while Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized addressing backlogs and aligning with demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our order quantities with recent demand trends and backlogs is crucial. Therefore, I will focus on minimizing our backlog while preparing for potential demand surges. I suggest we establish a shared platform to update on inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's create a collaborative platform to update inventory and demand forecasts weekly.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler mentioned a balanced approach to satisfy demand and Distributor noted fluctuating orders, which resonates with our observations of consistent demand around 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should maintain our current inventory strategy to handle potential surges while reducing excess stock. Therefore, I will continue ordering to keep inventory at a level that minimizes both stockouts and excess costs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly video call to share inventory levels and demand forecasts to fine-tune our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining a high inventory to meet consistent demand, while the Distributor and Factory emphasized addressing backlogs and preparing for fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our forecasts and inventory levels more closely. Therefore, I will focus on clearing my backlog and ordering enough to cover anticipated demand, while working to improve information sharing.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital platform for real-time updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 142 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 109, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [338]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 136
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (142 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 158 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [50, 110, 130]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 350
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (158 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of 11 units and Wholesaler spoke about aiming to address backlog and expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our inventory levels and order quantities. Therefore, I will focus on clearing my backlog and anticipate a similar demand pattern. I've noticed a fluctuating demand with recent orders of 31, 109, and 50 units, which suggests volatility. Let's work together to share more accurate demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose a weekly update on our current inventory levels and expected demand to improve synchronization.
- Factory: I hear that Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of 11 units and a strategy to maintain high inventory, while Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized addressing backlogs and aligning with demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our order quantities with recent demand trends and backlogs is crucial. Therefore, I will focus on minimizing our backlog while preparing for potential demand surges. I suggest we establish a shared platform to update on inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's create a collaborative platform to update inventory and demand forecasts weekly.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler mentioned a balanced approach to satisfy demand and Distributor noted fluctuating orders, which resonates with our observations of consistent demand around 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should maintain our current inventory strategy to handle potential surges while reducing excess stock. Therefore, I will continue ordering to keep inventory at a level that minimizes both stockouts and excess costs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly video call to share inventory levels and demand forecasts to fine-tune our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining a high inventory to meet consistent demand, while the Distributor and Factory emphasized addressing backlogs and preparing for fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our forecasts and inventory levels more closely. Therefore, I will focus on clearing my backlog and ordering enough to cover anticipated demand, while working to improve information sharing.
  Proposal: Let's establish a shared digital platform for real-time updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts.
- Distributor: I hear that Retailer and Wholesaler have both emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced inventory and addressing backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must prioritize backlog reduction and align our demand forecasts to handle volatility. Therefore, I will focus on ordering enough to clear my backlog while anticipating fluctuating demand. Let's work together to improve our demand forecasting and inventory updates.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round

          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned an expected demand increase to around 50 units, and the Wholesaler is preparing for a demand surge. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to ensure supply chain stability. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure I can meet this potential demand while managing my inventory effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our incoming order quantities and anticipated demand to synchronize our supply chain decisions and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all mentioned a potential demand increase to 50 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must prepare for this potential spike while managing our backlog efficiently. Therefore, I will adjust my order strategy to ensure that our production can meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order plans and share demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory are all anticipating a demand increase to 50 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are aligned in expecting a surge, which could strain our supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 60 units to ensure I can meet expected demand without significantly increasing inventory costs.
  Proposal: Let's continue to share our demand forecasts and order plans to prevent overreaction and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer, Distributor, and Factory are anticipating a demand increase to 50 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we might face significant supply chain pressure.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 8 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [300]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 48
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [109, 50, 110]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 205
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 423 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [82]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 48 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [132]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler discussed a stable demand pattern of 11-14 units and support weekly forecast sharing. Based on this, my conclusion is that while a stable pattern exists downstream, my recent demand has been volatile, with orders of 50, 110, and 82 units. Therefore, I will support the weekly forecast sharing to better align with overall demand and reduce variability.
  Proposal: Let's formalize our weekly demand forecast meetings and include a shared dashboard for real-time updates.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor are supporting the proposal for weekly demand forecast sharing based on the stable demand pattern of 11-14 units observed by the Retailer. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning on these insights can help us manage the backlog and prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my expected demand to 50 units for the next round and support the forecast sharing initiative to improve synchronization across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's solidify our weekly demand forecast sharing meetings and include a shared dashboard for real-time updates.

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a stable demand pattern averaging 11-14 units and proposed weekly demand forecast sharing. I also understand that the Wholesaler supports this initiative. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning our forecasts could help us optimize inventory levels and reduce costs. Therefore, I will support the weekly forecast sharing proposal and adjust my expectations accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's formalize a weekly demand forecast sharing meeting to better synchronize our supply chain decisions.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor discussed a stable demand pattern of 11-14 units and proposed weekly demand forecast sharing. Based on this, my conclusion is that better alignment on expected demand can help manage our backlog and inventory levels. Therefore, I will support the proposal for weekly demand forecast sharing to improve synchronization across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's initiate a weekly demand forecast sharing to align our inventory levels and orders, reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler supports aligning demand forecasts based on the stable pattern of 11-14 units, and the Distributor and Factory are on board with weekly forecast sharing. Based on this, my conclusion is that synchronizing our demand expectations will help stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to maintain a higher inventory to buffer against unexpected surges and support the proposal for weekly forecast meetings.
  Proposal: Let's solidify our weekly demand forecast sharing meetings to ensure we are aligned and prepared.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer and other agents are observing a stable demand pattern of 11-14 units and supporting weekly demand forecast meetings.

Therefore, I will support the proposal for weekly forecast meetings and adjust my expected demand accordingly to optimize my orders.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly meeting to share demand forecasts and align our strategies.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler discussed a stable demand pattern of 11-14 units and support weekly forecast sharing. Based on this, my conclusion is that while a stable pattern exists downstream, my recent demand has been volatile, with orders of 50, 110, and 82 units. Therefore, I will support the weekly forecast sharing to better align with overall demand and reduce variability.
  Proposal: Let's formalize our weekly demand forecast meetings and include a shared dashboard for real-time updates.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor are supporting the proposal for weekly demand forecast sharing based on the stable demand pattern of 11-14 units observed by the Retailer. Based on this, my conclusion is that aligning on these insights can help us manage the backlog and prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my expected demand to 50 units for the next round and support the forecast sharing initiative to improve synchronization across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's solidify our weekly demand forecast sharing meetings and include a shared dashboard for real-time updates.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 519, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 50, Units sold: 14, Profit: 70.00, Total Profit: -655.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=50, confidence=0.85, rationale=We anticipate a steady demand pattern and aim to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs., risk_assessment=Unexpected demand spikes could lead to increased backlog and stockouts., expected_demand_next_round=13, llm_inventory=519, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10, 14, 14], llm_incoming=[54], llm_last_order=40
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 519 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 14, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 294 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [300, 132, 74]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 309
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Communication Output: {"message": "I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasize the consistent demand pattern averaging 13 units and the importance of aligning inventory with demand.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 100,
          "backlog": 0,
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,
          "rationale": "<brief explanation of your reasoning>",
          "risk_assessment": "<describe any risks you anticipate>",
          "expected_demand_next_round": <integer>,
          "order_quantity": <integer>
        }

        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no markdown, no triple backticks, no code fences, and do NOT write the word 'json' anywhere. Your reply must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else. If you include anything else, your answer will be rejected. KEEP IT RATHER SHORT
