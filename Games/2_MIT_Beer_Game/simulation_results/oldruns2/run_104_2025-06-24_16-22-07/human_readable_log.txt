Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 114, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -28.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=To maintain a buffer against potential demand spikes while avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, causing either excess inventory or backlogs., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=102, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8], llm_incoming=[8], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly communication channel to share order forecasts and consumption trends, which can help us better align our order quantities and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively low, with only 8 units ordered. It’s crucial for us as a supply chain to anticipate this might continue. I suggest a careful review of order quantities to avoid excess inventory without missing demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 10 units to ensure we have enough stock while managing my inventory effectively.
  Proposal: Let’s establish a regular communication schedule to better align our forecasts and orders, minimizing the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that demand forecasts among other agents indicate fluctuations which could lead to excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to better align inventory levels. Therefore, I propose sharing our demand forecasts and current inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory status to optimize our ordering decisions.
- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand of 8 units and anticipate a need for 30 units next round. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should all prepare for. I hear that coordination in our orders could significantly mitigate the bullwhip effect, as echoed by previous rounds' data. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels more closely. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units to ensure we maintain adequate stock without risking excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our anticipated demands for the next rounds regularly to better align our order quantities and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent sales trends. This aligns with my observation of fluctuating demand and the risk of backlog increasing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our order quantities to avoid exacerbating any inventory issues. Therefore, I will continue with my planned order of 50 units to maintain sufficient inventory while being prepared for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demands for the next round to better align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear there might be fluctuations in demand, which could lead to excess inventory or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate expected demand more clearly. Therefore, I will place an order for 10 units to maintain optimal stock levels while anticipating the increased demand in the next round.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts from all agents to prevent over-ordering and under-delivering.

- Wholesaler: I have observed a recent demand of 8 units and anticipate a need for 30 units next round. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should all prepare for. I hear that coordination in our orders could significantly mitigate the bullwhip effect, as echoed by previous rounds' data. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels more closely. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units to ensure we maintain adequate stock without risking excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our anticipated demands for the next rounds regularly to better align our order quantities and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent sales trends. This aligns with my observation of fluctuating demand and the risk of backlog increasing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our order quantities to avoid exacerbating any inventory issues. Therefore, I will continue with my planned order of 50 units to maintain sufficient inventory while being prepared for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demands for the next round to better align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear there might be fluctuations in demand, which could lead to excess inventory or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate expected demand more clearly. Therefore, I will place an order for 10 units to maintain optimal stock levels while anticipating the increased demand in the next round.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts from all agents to prevent over-ordering and under-delivering.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I observe that demand is unpredictable and has been low recently with only a recent order of 8 units recorded. It's crucial that we all stay aligned to avoid excess inventory and potential backlog issues. Let's work together to better anticipate future demand changes.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly communication channel to share order forecasts and consumption trends, which can help us better align our order quantities and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively low, with only 8 units ordered. It’s crucial for us as a supply chain to anticipate this might continue.

Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units to ensure we maintain adequate stock without risking excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our anticipated demands for the next rounds regularly to better align our order quantities and avoid stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent sales trends. This aligns with my observation of fluctuating demand and the risk of backlog increasing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our order quantities to avoid exacerbating any inventory issues. Therefore, I will continue with my planned order of 50 units to maintain sufficient inventory while being prepared for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demands for the next round to better align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear there might be fluctuations in demand, which could lead to excess inventory or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate expected demand more clearly. Therefore, I will place an order for 10 units to maintain optimal stock levels while anticipating the increased demand in the next round.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand forecasts from all agents to prevent over-ordering and under-delivering.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 117 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -17.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a recent spike in demand with orders of 27 following an order of 8. This suggests a potential increase in consumer interest. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for potentially higher demand moving forward. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels while placing an order of 50 to ensure we can meet demand without generating backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly order forecasts among all agents to better align our inventory and ordering strategies, which could mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 5 units in inventory and no backlog. I have noticed significant fluctuations in recent demand, especially the spike to 57 units. To avoid future shortages or excess, it would be wise for us to synchronize our order quantities more closely based on anticipated demand trends. I encourage you to share your expected demands so we can better align our inventories.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned that they are seeing variability in demand which may lead to overstock. This aligns with my own observations of fluctuating orders, with recent demand at 7 and 8 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about overordering. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I still have a buffer while being mindful of the overall supply chain health.
  Proposal: I suggest regular updates on demand trends to better align our orders and minimize excess inventory across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I observe that recent demand has been steady with orders of 8 and 7 units in the last rounds. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining adequate inventory levels across the supply chain is crucial. Therefore, I will place my next order for 30 units to ensure we can meet demand and avoid any disruptions.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand and inventory levels from all agents to enhance visibility and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned fluctuating demand patterns leading to challenges in maintaining inventory. This highlights the importance of aligning our orders to keep the supply chain responsive. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about demand forecasts to better plan our orders. Therefore, I will suggest we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand figures for the next few rounds to enhance visibility across the supply chain.
- Factory: As the Factory, I see that demand spikes can lead to significant inventory fluctuations. I hear no other agents have communicated yet, so I want to emphasize the importance of clear and timely information sharing to avoid excessive orders and inventory build-up. Collaboration in forecasting demand will be critical to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share forecasts and actual sales data to better align our inventory levels across the supply chain.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 95 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [57]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 44.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet demand while avoiding stockouts. I anticipate a steady demand and want to minimize costs.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a recent spike in demand with orders of 27 following an order of 8. This suggests a potential increase in consumer interest. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for potentially higher demand moving forward. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels while placing an order of 50 to ensure we can meet demand without generating backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly order forecasts among all agents to better align our inventory and ordering strategies, which could mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 5 units in inventory and no backlog. I have noticed significant fluctuations in recent demand, especially the spike to 57 units. To avoid future shortages or excess, it would be wise for us to synchronize our order quantities more closely based on anticipated demand trends. I encourage you to share your expected demands so we can better align our inventories.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned that they are seeing variability in demand which may lead to overstock. This aligns with my own observations of fluctuating orders, with recent demand at 7 and 8 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about overordering. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I still have a buffer while being mindful of the overall supply chain health.
  Proposal: I suggest regular updates on demand trends to better align our orders and minimize excess inventory across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I observe that recent demand has been steady with orders of 8 and 7 units in the last rounds. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining adequate inventory levels across the supply chain is crucial. Therefore, I will place my next order for 30 units to ensure we can meet demand and avoid any disruptions.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand and inventory levels from all agents to enhance visibility and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned fluctuating demand patterns leading to challenges in maintaining inventory. This highlights the importance of aligning our orders to keep the supply chain responsive. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about demand forecasts to better plan our orders. Therefore, I will suggest we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand figures for the next few rounds to enhance visibility across the supply chain.
- Factory: As the Factory, I see that demand spikes can lead to significant inventory fluctuations. I hear no other agents have communicated yet, so I want to emphasize the importance of clear and timely information sharing to avoid excessive orders and inventory build-up. Collaboration in forecasting demand will be critical to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share forecasts and actual sales data to better align our inventory levels across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 5 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 57]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [57]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 109.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, it's essential to maintain a buffer while anticipating demand fluctuations.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential demand changes could lead to excess inventory or unfulfilled orders, impacting costs.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed a recent spike in demand with orders of 27 following an order of 8. This suggests a potential increase in consumer interest. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for potentially higher demand moving forward. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels while placing an order of 50 to ensure we can meet demand without generating backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly order forecasts among all agents to better align our inventory and ordering strategies, which could mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 5 units in inventory and no backlog. I have noticed significant fluctuations in recent demand, especially the spike to 57 units. To avoid future shortages or excess, it would be wise for us to synchronize our order quantities more closely based on anticipated demand trends. I encourage you to share your expected demands so we can better align our inventories.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned that they are seeing variability in demand which may lead to overstock. This aligns with my own observations of fluctuating orders, with recent demand at 7 and 8 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about overordering. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I still have a buffer while being mindful of the overall supply chain health.
  Proposal: I suggest regular updates on demand trends to better align our orders and minimize excess inventory across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I observe that recent demand has been steady with orders of 8 and 7 units in the last rounds. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining adequate inventory levels across the supply chain is crucial. Therefore, I will place my next order for 30 units to ensure we can meet demand and avoid any disruptions.
  Proposal: I propose regular updates on demand and inventory levels from all agents to enhance visibility and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned fluctuating demand patterns leading to challenges in maintaining inventory. This highlights the importance of aligning our orders to keep the supply chain responsive. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about demand forecasts to better plan our orders. Therefore, I will suggest we share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand figures for the next few rounds to enhance visibility across the supply chain.
- Factory: As the Factory, I see that demand spikes can lead to significant inventory fluctuations. I hear no other agents have communicated yet, so I want to emphasize the importance of clear and timely information sharing to avoid excessive orders and inventory build-up. Collaboration in forecasting demand will be critical to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share forecasts and actual sales data to better align our inventory levels across the supply chain.
