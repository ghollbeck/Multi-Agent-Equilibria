--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand of 9 units, which may indicate a potential increase in demand. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain sufficient stock.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 9 units, which may indicate a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to prepare for anticipated demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both mentioned a recent demand of 9 units, indicating a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be proactive in managing our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to ensure we are prepared for the anticipated demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all mentioned a recent demand of 9 units, indicating a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be proactive in managing our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue to share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 102, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -11.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.8, rationale=To maintain inventory and meet expected demand, I will order enough to cover the recent demand and keep a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand may increase unexpectedly, leading to stockouts if not managed properly., expected_demand_next_round=9, llm_inventory=101, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9], llm_incoming=[9], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 9 units, which may indicate a potential increase in demand. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively low, with only 9 units ordered. This suggests we should be cautious about over-ordering. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively low, with only 9 units ordered. This suggests we should be cautious about over-ordering. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that the recent demand is 9 units, which suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend that we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 2 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a consistent demand of 9 units in the last two rounds. This suggests a stable demand pattern. However, I anticipate a potential increase in demand next round. Therefore, I will adjust my order accordingly to maintain sufficient inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to prepare for the expected increase in demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we all share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 103 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they anticipate a potential increase in demand next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for higher orders to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory to meet expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to align with the anticipated increase in demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we all share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 91 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to potential demand increases.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they anticipate a potential increase in demand next round. I also note that Wholesaler agrees with this assessment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for higher orders to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain sufficient inventory and meet expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to align with the anticipated increase in demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we continue sharing our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 84 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to potential demand increases.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all anticipate a potential increase in demand next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for higher orders to avoid stockouts. However, I also have sufficient inventory at the moment, which allows me to be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer but will not overcommit to high orders to mitigate holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 15 units to balance between maintaining inventory and avoiding excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we all share our actual demand data after each round to better align our future orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 73 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to respond to potential demand increases without overcommitting.
  Confidence: 0.8

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 114, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -30.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=To cover expected demand and maintain a buffer, I will order 20 units., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, leading to potential overstock or stockouts if not managed carefully., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=103, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 9], llm_incoming=[19], llm_last_order=10
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 103 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -6.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a consistent demand of 9 units in the last rounds. This suggests a stable demand pattern. However, I anticipate a potential increase in demand next round. Therefore, I will adjust my order accordingly to maintain sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I have observed consistent demand of 9 units in the last two rounds. This suggests a stable demand pattern. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increases in demand. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units to ensure we have enough stock to meet future needs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a significant increase in orders. It is crucial for us to coordinate our efforts to manage inventory effectively and avoid overreacting to demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain responses. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential demand changes while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a consistent demand of 9 units in the last rounds. This suggests a stable demand pattern. However, I anticipate a potential increase in demand next round. Therefore, I will adjust my order accordingly to maintain sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I have observed consistent demand of 9 units in the last two rounds. This suggests a stable demand pattern. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increases in demand. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units to ensure we have enough stock to meet future needs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a significant increase in orders. It is crucial for us to coordinate our efforts to manage inventory effectively and avoid overreacting to demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain responses. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential demand changes while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [9, 9, 9, 19]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to align our orders more effectively. Therefore, I will share my recent demand of 9, 9, and 7 units to help us coordinate better.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a steady inventory while anticipating demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My recent demand has been 9, 9, and 7 units, and I currently have 116 units in inventory.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should share our recent demand data to align our orders more effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for potential demand increases. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock without risking excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to balance my order quantity with observed demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our orders.
  Information Shared: My recent demand has been 9, 9, and 7 units, and I currently have 73 units in inventory.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should share our recent demand data to align our orders more effectively. I also note the Wholesaler's caution about over-ordering while preparing for demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider the recent demand trends to optimize our orders and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to balance stock levels and anticipated demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to keep my order quantity aligned with observed demand trends while managing inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our orders.
  Information Shared: My recent demand has been 9, 19, and 27 units, and I currently have 46 units in inventory.
  Confidence: 0.8

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will provide my recent demand figures to help us align our orders better.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand data regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with significant increases. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we have enough inventory to meet potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to keep a buffer for the upcoming rounds.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without excessive holding costs.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [36]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: 38.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that our recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 9, 7, and 6 units. This suggests a potential downward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about overordering. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand patterns to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating with a slight downward trend. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match the actual demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to balance inventory and demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders peaking at 47 units. This suggests potential volatility in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overreacting to spikes. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate possible increases in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that our recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 9, 7, and 6 units. This suggests a potential downward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about overordering. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand patterns to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating with a slight downward trend. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match the actual demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to balance inventory and demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders peaking at 47 units. This suggests potential volatility in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overreacting to spikes. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate possible increases in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 110 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 6, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: 7.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 12 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 12 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order to prepare for potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around 20-27 units. This suggests a potential stabilization in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to align with the expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 47, 36, and 37 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any sudden spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 12 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 12 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order to prepare for potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around 20-27 units. This suggests a potential stabilization in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to align with the expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 47, 36, and 37 units. This indicates a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our inventory levels to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any sudden spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 115 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: 47.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 and 12 units. I hear that maintaining consistent orders is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to match demand more closely. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 and 12 units, with a potential spike in the next round. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 21 and 26 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 36 and 41 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes in orders.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 and 12 units. I hear that maintaining consistent orders is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to match demand more closely. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 and 12 units, with a potential spike in the next round. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 21 and 26 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 36 and 41 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes in orders.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 135 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 6, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [45]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -1.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 12, 6, and 13 units. I hear that maintaining consistent inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I have enough stock while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a recent spike in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increases in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet any sudden demand.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without excessive holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 22 and 26 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better inventory management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we have sufficient stock across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order to the Factory to prepare for potential demand increases while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand increasing steadily, with the last three orders being 37, 41, and 45 units. This trend suggests a potential rise in demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to better match the observed demand trends and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 88 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [37, 41, 45]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [45]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: 82.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 12, 6, and 13 units. I hear that maintaining consistent inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I have enough stock while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a recent spike in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential increases in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet any sudden demand.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without excessive holding costs.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 22 and 26 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better inventory management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we have sufficient stock across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order to the Factory to prepare for potential demand increases while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand increasing steadily, with the last three orders being 37, 41, and 45 units. This trend suggests a potential rise in demand. Therefore, I recommend that we all consider adjusting our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to better match the observed demand trends and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 145 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 13, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 32.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand trends to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 25 and 31 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without excessive holding costs.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand trends to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 25 and 31 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet demand without excessive holding costs.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand trends to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order based on my expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 13 units. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels, which could impact us all. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand trends to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order based on my expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 13 units. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels, which could impact us all. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 25 and 31 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating around the 45-51 unit range. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 276 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -93.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 7 and 11 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory to meet potential demand while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 27 and 31 units. This suggests a potential stabilization in demand. I encourage everyone to consider this trend in their ordering decisions to avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with the observed demand patterns, which may help reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 228 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -1.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 11 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [27, 47, 77, 94]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy while being open to adjustments based on our collective demand insights.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 303 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 9 units.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need to monitor order patterns to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders more closely to recent demand trends to optimize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the expected demand while maintaining a buffer for fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a safety stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 201 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 9 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid overstocking or stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned aligning orders more closely to recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the expected demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy while being open to adjustments based on our collective demand insights.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid overstocking or stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned aligning orders more closely to recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the expected demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while adjusting my order to reflect recent demand trends more closely.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a safety stock.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 303 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 11, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -87.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 and 11 units. I hear that maintaining a steady order quantity is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to ensure we have enough stock without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 27 and 31 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating around the 47-51 unit range. This suggests a potential for variability in future orders. I recommend we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts or excess holding costs. Coordination on order quantities could help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our order quantities and inventory levels regularly to better align our supply chain responses.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 266 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [27, 31, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [79]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -19.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 and 11 units. I hear that maintaining a steady order quantity is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to ensure we have enough stock without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 27 and 31 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating around the 47-51 unit range. This suggests a potential for variability in future orders. I recommend we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts or excess holding costs. Coordination on order quantities could help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our order quantities and inventory levels regularly to better align our supply chain responses.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [31, 51, 81, 102]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I have enough stock to meet anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better synchronize our orders.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 323 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 10-12 units.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning on expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider recent demand trends to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while ensuring I have enough stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 240 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 10-12 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid overstocking or stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the importance of considering recent demand trends.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid overstocking or stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor mention the importance of considering recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent excess inventory while still preparing for potential demand. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order quantity to ensure we have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better synchronize our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 323 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [22]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -107.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 11, 9, and 12 units. I hear that maintaining a steady supply is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the demand trends. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units this round to ensure we have enough stock while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to ensure we have enough stock without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with values of 31, 29, and 22. This suggests a potential decrease in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to avoid overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating around the 40-50 unit range. It seems we are all experiencing similar patterns. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce the bullwhip effect. This could help us all manage our inventory more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders better.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 315 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 29, 22]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [72]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -38.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 11, 9, and 12 units. I hear that maintaining a steady supply is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match the demand trends. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units this round to ensure we have enough stock while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy to ensure we have enough stock without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with values of 31, 29, and 22. This suggests a potential decrease in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to avoid overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating around the 40-50 unit range. It seems we are all experiencing similar patterns. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce the bullwhip effect. This could help us all manage our inventory more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders better.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [29, 49, 79, 99]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that our recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 9, 12, and 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 340 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they observed fluctuations in demand and plan to adjust their order to maintain sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while preparing for potential demand increases. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory levels without risking excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping my inventory in check.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 271 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they observed fluctuations in demand and plan to adjust their order to maintain sufficient stock. I also hear the Wholesaler concluded we should be cautious about over-ordering while preparing for potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid excess inventory while being ready for demand spikes. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock without risking over-ordering.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively while monitoring demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 380 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they observed fluctuations in demand and plan to adjust their order to maintain sufficient stock. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor concluded we should be cautious about over-ordering while preparing for potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid excess inventory while being ready for demand spikes. Therefore, I will order conservatively to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations while avoiding overstock.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively while monitoring demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 308 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet upcoming demand.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 350, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -1509.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=To cover expected demand and maintain a buffer, I will order more than the recent average demand., risk_assessment=Demand may increase unexpectedly, leading to stockouts if not managed properly., expected_demand_next_round=12, llm_inventory=340, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 12, 10], llm_incoming=[20], llm_last_order=10
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 340 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 12, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -100.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 9 to 12 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a proactive ordering strategy to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a slight downward trend. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 49, 42, and 32 units. This suggests a potential decrease in demand. Therefore, I recommend we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid overstocking and incurring holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels and recent demand patterns to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 380 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 22, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [62]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -106.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 9 to 12 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain a proactive ordering strategy to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a slight downward trend. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders collectively.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 49, 42, and 32 units. This suggests a potential decrease in demand. Therefore, I recommend we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid overstocking and incurring holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels and recent demand patterns to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

--------------------- Round 14 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [22, 42, 72, 92]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 9 to 12 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand trend. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet anticipated demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 363 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and that they will adjust their order to ensure enough stock to meet anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our inventory levels and recent demand trends to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current inventory and anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 366, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 12, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -1784.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=12, confidence=0.8, rationale=To maintain inventory and meet expected demand, I will order 12 units, covering recent demand trends., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, but with a buffer, I can mitigate stockout risks., expected_demand_next_round=12, llm_inventory=363, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[12, 10, 9], llm_incoming=[29], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 363 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -125.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 9 to 12 units. I hear that maintaining consistent orders is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to match demand more closely. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to maintain my inventory levels while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with values of 12, 10, and 9. This suggests a potential downward trend. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 20 and 29 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Therefore, I will share that I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 32 and 42 units. This suggests a potential for variability in future orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order strategy to buffer against potential demand drops.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 429 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [22, 20, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [71]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -139.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 9 to 12 units. I hear that maintaining consistent orders is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to match demand more closely. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to maintain my inventory levels while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with values of 12, 10, and 9. This suggests a potential downward trend. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 20 and 29 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Therefore, I will share that I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 32 and 42 units. This suggests a potential for variability in future orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order strategy to buffer against potential demand drops.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

--------------------- Round 15 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [20, 32, 62, 82]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively stable, with numbers around 9 to 10 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels while anticipating future demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet expected demand without creating excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 376 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain inventory levels while anticipating future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aiming to keep our inventories aligned with stable demand. Therefore, I will also order 20 units to ensure I have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet expected demand without creating excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we continue to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 294 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain inventory levels while anticipating future demand, and Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned in our approach to manage inventory with stable demand. Therefore, I will also order 20 units to ensure I maintain sufficient stock while preparing for potential fluctuations in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet expected demand without creating excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we continue to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they will be ordering 20 units this round to maintain inventory levels while anticipating future demand. Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment, all aiming to keep inventories aligned with stable demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all focused on managing our inventories effectively. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while being mindful of potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I am maintaining a buffer to prepare for demand fluctuations while aligning with the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we continue to share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 386, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -2065.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=To maintain inventory levels and prepare for expected demand, I will order to cover both current demand and maintain a buffer., risk_assessment=There is a risk of overstock if demand does not increase as anticipated, but stockouts must be avoided., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=376, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10, 9, 10], llm_incoming=[22], llm_last_order=12
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 376 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [22]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -138.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstock or stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been stable around 10 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible increases in demand while avoiding overstock. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough inventory to meet any spikes in demand without incurring excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 20 and 29 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 32 and 42 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 454 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 29, 22]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [67]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: -117.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our inventory levels and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstock or stockouts.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been stable around 10 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about potential fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible increases in demand while avoiding overstock. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough inventory to meet any spikes in demand without incurring excessive holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 20 and 29 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to prepare for this trend.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 32 and 42 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 16 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [29, 41, 71, 81]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a steady order quantity to balance inventory and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 409 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that recent demand has fluctuated between 6 to 10 units and suggested coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our expected demand to optimize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential demand increases while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while managing my inventory effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 309 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said that recent demand has fluctuated between 6 to 10 units and suggested coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking. I also hear Wholesaler agrees and plans to maintain their order quantity to prepare for potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our expected demand to optimize our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain stock while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively while monitoring demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 489 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said that recent demand has fluctuated between 6 to 10 units and suggested coordinating our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking. I also note that Wholesaler and Distributor agree on maintaining their order quantities to prepare for potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our expected demand to optimize our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have a buffer for potential demand fluctuations while avoiding excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 394 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.8

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 423, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 6, Profit: 30.00, Total Profit: -2421.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will order to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand may increase unexpectedly, leading to potential stockouts if not managed., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=409, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 10, 6], llm_incoming=[26], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 409 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -143.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 10 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we are prepared for potential demand spikes.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 22 and 29 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a cautious approach to ordering to avoid excess inventory while preparing for possible higher demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 41 and 46 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes in orders.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking. Let's share our expected demand to align our inventory levels better.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 10 units. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we are prepared for potential demand spikes.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 22 and 29 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a cautious approach to ordering to avoid excess inventory while preparing for possible higher demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 41 and 46 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes in orders.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--------------------- Round 17 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [22, 42, 67, 82]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will share my recent demand of 10, 6, and 12 units to help us align our orders better.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain my inventory while anticipating demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.

  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and shared their recent demand data. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential demand increases while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on observed demand trends while managing my inventory effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and optimize our orders.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. I also note the Wholesaler's emphasis on aligning orders to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider the recent demand trends to optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my recent demand of 22, 26, and 32 units to help us align our strategies better.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain my inventory while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to regularly share our recent demand data to enhance our forecasting accuracy and minimize fluctuations.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will share my recent demand patterns to help us coordinate better.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for higher orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand and avoid backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet the expected demand efficiently.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a trend towards higher orders. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This will help reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders more effectively.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 42, 46, and 52 units. This indicates a potential upward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for possible increases in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any sudden spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will share my recent demand patterns to help us coordinate better.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for higher orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet this demand and avoid backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet the expected demand efficiently.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a trend towards higher orders. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This will help reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders more effectively.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating, with the last three orders being 42, 46, and 52 units. This indicates a potential upward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for possible increases in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any sudden spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while minimizing the risk of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 26 and 32 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking while ensuring we meet demand.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while minimizing the risk of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 26 and 32 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking while ensuring we meet demand.

          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough stock to meet this anticipated demand while minimizing the risk of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated between 26 and 32 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand that we should prepare for. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory without risking excess holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders increasing from 46 to 62 units. This trend suggests potential variability in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate possible spikes in demand while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively stable, with the last three orders averaging around 12-14 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of around 12-14 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for stable demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet this demand without delays.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet the demand efficiently.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around the low 30s. This suggests we may not need to overreact to fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 52 and 64 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes in orders.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 371 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 12, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [64]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -76.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively stable, with the last three orders averaging around 12-14 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of around 12-14 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for stable demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet this demand without delays.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet the demand efficiently.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around the low 30s. This suggests we may not need to overreact to fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 52 and 64 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes in orders.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively stable, with the last three orders averaging around 12-14 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a consistent demand of around 12-14 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for stable demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels to ensure we can meet this demand without delays.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and ensure we can meet the demand efficiently.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around the low 30s. This suggests we may not need to overreact to fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 52 and 64 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to accommodate any spikes in orders.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating between 11 to 14 units. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating around the low 30s, which suggests a stable but cautious approach is needed. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Let's keep an eye on demand trends together.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering. Therefore, I will continue to keep a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while being cautious of holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 402 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 14, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -85.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating between 11 to 14 units. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating around the low 30s, which suggests a stable but cautious approach is needed. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Let's keep an eye on demand trends together.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering. Therefore, I will continue to keep a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while being cautious of holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 521 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [62, 64, 51]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 62
          - Last round profit: -71.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better coordinate our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating between 11 to 14 units. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my inventory while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating around the low 30s, which suggests a stable but cautious approach is needed. I recommend we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Let's keep an eye on demand trends together.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering. Therefore, I will continue to keep a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while being cautious of holding costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.
