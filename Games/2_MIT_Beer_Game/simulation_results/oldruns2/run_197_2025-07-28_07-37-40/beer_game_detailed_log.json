I'm currently profitable, with $322.40 in total earnings so far. However, I'm concerned about the risk of stockouts, which could severely impact my profits and the entire supply chain. To prevent this, I propose that we all work together to maintain a 1-round inventory cover across the chain. This will help us respond quickly to demand fluctuations and avoid costly backorders. I'm willing to share my inventory and demand data to help us coordinate. By working together, we can maximize our collective profits and ensure the long-term stability of the supply chain. What do you all think?",

I believe we can work together to maximize the overall supply chain profitability. \n\nTo start, I propose that we all aim to maintain a 1-round inventory cover to prevent stockouts and minimize holding/backlog costs. This will require close coordination on order quantities and production planning. I'm willing to share my inventory status and order plans transparently if the other agents do the same. \n\nBy working together, we can avoid the bullwhip effect and keep the supply chain stable.
