--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-73.00, and I have 191 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 191 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand without risking stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 191, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 9, Units sold: 9, Profit: 22.50, Total Profit: -73.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=9, confidence=0.9, rationale=I have sufficient inventory to meet the expected demand of 9 units while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=The main risk is underestimating future demand, which could lead to stock-outs., expected_demand_next_round=9, llm_inventory=191, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9], llm_incoming=[9], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 191 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 191 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to meet expected demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 50 units this round to match the recent demand and maintain a balanced inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies closely to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is $-73.00, and I have 191 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain, especially considering that I can only ship orders plus my backlog.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 191 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to meet expected demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 50 units this round to match the recent demand and maintain a balanced inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent stock-outs and maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies closely to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. My current profit is $-73.00, and I have 191 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain, especially considering that I can only ship orders plus my backlog.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 191 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to meet expected demand while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to meet expected demand while minimizing excess inventory.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining stability in our supply chain. My current profit is $-135.50, and I have 180 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if we do not coordinate effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to avoid overreacting to fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.9, rationale=To meet expected demand and maintain a buffer, I will order 10 units., risk_assessment=Risk of stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly; need to balance inventory levels., expected_demand_next_round=10, llm_inventory=180, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=9
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for collaboration to prevent stock-outs and proposed sharing demand forecasts. The Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, highlighting the importance of aligning our orders to avoid destabilizing the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 180 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at $-135.50. I propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next rounds and align our orders accordingly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could hurt all our profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-135.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (180 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating orders to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders effectively to ensure we meet customer demand while avoiding excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs, considering my current profit of $-206.00 and my inventory of 181 units with no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent stock-outs and excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating orders to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-206.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (181 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 172 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-201.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (172 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to maintain supply chain stability and expressed concerns about potential stock-outs.

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 3. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [11, 8, 11]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Total profit so far: $-269.00

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game, Round 3. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [11, 8, 11]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Total profit so far: $-269.00

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 161 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-254.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (161 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 184 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to optimize our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. My current profit is at $-348.50, and I have an inventory of 184 units with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill orders without delay, but we must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. My current profit is at $-320.00, and I have an inventory of 156 units with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules more transparently to optimize our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten all our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to optimize our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. My current profit is at $-348.50, and I have an inventory of 184 units with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill orders without delay, but we must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. My current profit is at $-320.00, and I have an inventory of 156 units with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules more transparently to optimize our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten all our profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 184 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to optimize our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. My current profit is at $-348.50, and I have an inventory of 184 units with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill orders without delay, but we must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. My current profit is at $-320.00, and I have an inventory of 156 units with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules more transparently to optimize our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten all our profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 156 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 11, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and forecasts to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to optimize our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply. My current profit is at $-348.50, and I have an inventory of 184 units with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill orders without delay, but we must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our supply chain and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. My current profit is at $-320.00, and I have an inventory of 156 units with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules more transparently to optimize our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten all our profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration among all agents is crucial to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady supply. My current profit is $-416.00, and I have 185 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation is delicate, as any misalignment in orders could lead to stock-outs or excess inventory, impacting our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 185 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 5, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 185 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 5, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady supply. Given my current profit of $-416.00 and my inventory of 185 units with no backlog, I recognize that any misalignment in orders could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady supply. Given my current profit of $-368.00 and my inventory of 146 units with no backlog, I recognize that any misalignment in orders could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 185 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 5, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady supply. Given my current profit of $-416.00 and my inventory of 185 units with no backlog, I recognize that any misalignment in orders could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady supply. Given my current profit of $-368.00 and my inventory of 146 units with no backlog, I recognize that any misalignment in orders could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 146 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 5, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and maintain steady supply. Given my current profit of $-416.00 and my inventory of 185 units with no backlog, I recognize that any misalignment in orders could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-499.00, and I have 186 units in inventory with no backlog. If we don't manage our orders carefully, we risk a collapse in the supply chain, which will hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us avoid the bullwhip effect and keep our costs in check.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.

Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. They both mentioned the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more explicitly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs, which could severely impact my current profit of $-499.00. I currently have 186 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders effectively this round, but we must be cautious about future demand fluctuations. Let's coordinate our strategies to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any potential collapse.

Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment. My current profit is $-499.00, and I have 186 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect true market demand and prevent excess inventory, which threatens all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities explicitly to optimize our supply chain and ensure we all remain profitable. We need to be cautious about stockouts and oversupply, as they could lead to a collapse in the supply chain, impacting everyone's profits. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so let's plan accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products and minimize costs.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 186, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 4, Profit: 10.00, Total Profit: -499.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.8, rationale=To meet expected demand and maintain a buffer, I will order 10 units., risk_assessment=Risk of stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly., expected_demand_next_round=10, llm_inventory=186, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[5, 10, 4], llm_incoming=[4], llm_last_order=10
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 186 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 186 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-499.00, and I have 186 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and ensure we all remain profitable. We need to be cautious about stockouts and oversupply, as they threaten our profits and could lead to a collapse in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our orders and share demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $-429.00, and I have 142 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain and ensure we all remain profitable. We need to be cautious about stockouts and oversupply, as they threaten our profits and could lead to a collapse in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to coordinate our production and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. They both mentioned the importance of aligning our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect true market demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more explicitly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs, which could severely impact my current profit of $-499.00. I currently have 186 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders effectively this round, but we must be cautious about future demand fluctuations.

- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Distributor echoed this sentiment. My current profit is $-499.00, and I have 186 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to reflect true market demand and prevent excess inventory, which threatens all our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities explicitly to optimize our supply chain and ensure we all remain profitable. We need to be cautious about stockouts and oversupply, as they could lead to a collapse in the supply chain, impacting everyone's profits. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so let's plan accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products and minimize costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities more explicitly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. They both mentioned the importance of aligning our orders to reflect true market demand and prevent excess inventory, which threatens all our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders are aligned and reflect the actual demand to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities explicitly to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential collapse, which could severely impact my current profit of $-499.00. I currently have 186 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders effectively this round, but we must be cautious about future demand fluctuations.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 186 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 26
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 142 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-576.00, and I have 189 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if we do not coordinate effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 189 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-576.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (189 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 189 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-576.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (189 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 189 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to align our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of coordinating our demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-576.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (189 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 135 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to align our orders to prevent oversupply and stock-outs, and Wholesaler echoed the importance of coordinating our demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits. I currently have 189 units in inventory and no backlog, but my total profit is $-576.00, which is concerning. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-479.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (135 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 184 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 184 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 8. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 184 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [4, 7, 9]

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-645.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (184 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 184 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game, Round 8. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 184 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [4, 7, 9]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Total profit so far: $-645.50
          - Current strategy: {

  "order_quantity": 50
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-645.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (184 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 126 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 8. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 126 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [4, 7, 9]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Total profit so far: $-519.50
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 200,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential risk of overproduction if demand fluctuates unexpectedly, leading to higher holding costs.",
  "d_demand_next_round": 50,
  "order_quantity": 50
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-519.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (126 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 186 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect actual demand and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maintain steady supply without risking stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our order quantities based on recent demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 186 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to stabilize our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect actual demand and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maintain steady supply without risking stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our order quantities based on recent demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to stabilize our supply chain.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 186 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders closely to avoid disruptions that could threaten our profits. My current profit is $-726.00, and I have 186 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, which could destabilize our supply chain and hurt all of our profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 121 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and maintain steady supply without risking stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our order quantities based on recent demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules closely with the expected demand to avoid excess inventory and ensure steady supply.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 185 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 5, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Given my current profit of $-793.50 and my inventory of 185 units with no backlog, I recognize the delicate balance we must maintain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to align with expected demand while preventing oversupply. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my inventory levels stable.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, which will help maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Given my current profit of $-598.00 and my inventory of 111 units with no backlog, I recognize that our collective decisions directly impact our profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to align with expected demand while preventing oversupply. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Given my current profit of $-793.50 and my inventory of 185 units with no backlog, I recognize the delicate balance we must maintain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to align with expected demand while preventing oversupply. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my inventory levels stable.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, which will help maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Given my current profit of $-598.00 and my inventory of 111 units with no backlog, I recognize that our collective decisions directly impact our profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to align with expected demand while preventing oversupply. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Given my current profit of $-793.50 and my inventory of 185 units with no backlog, I recognize the delicate balance we must maintain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to align with expected demand while preventing oversupply. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my inventory levels stable.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, which will help maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Given my current profit of $-598.00 and my inventory of 111 units with no backlog, I recognize that our collective decisions directly impact our profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to align with expected demand while preventing oversupply. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 111 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 5, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 7
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Given my current profit of $-793.50 and my inventory of 185 units with no backlog, I recognize the delicate balance we must maintain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to align with expected demand while preventing oversupply. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's needs while keeping my inventory levels stable.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, which will help maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Given my current profit of $-598.00 and my inventory of 111 units with no backlog, I recognize that our collective decisions directly impact our profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to align with expected demand while preventing oversupply. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to keep our orders aligned with the expected demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $-864.50, my inventory is 182 units, and I have no backlog. I can only ship based on the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to meet expected demand and prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production with the recent demand trends to avoid excess stock and ensure a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to match the recent demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level of 103 units and no backlog, which is crucial for maintaining stability in our operations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on recent demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maximize our profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 182 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 182 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet expected demand while considering our current inventory of 182 units and a backlog of 0 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to keep our orders aligned with the expected demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and avoid stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production with the expected demand to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to match the recent demand trend while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maximize our profits.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders closely to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which could jeopardize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to keep our orders aligned with the expected demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and avoid stock-outs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain stability and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to keep our orders aligned with the expected demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and avoid stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler proposed coordinating our orders closely. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet expected demand while considering my current profit of $-864.50, which is at risk due to potential stockouts or oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to keep our orders aligned with the expected demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and avoid stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to meet expected demand and prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production with the recent demand trends to avoid excess stock and ensure a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to match the recent demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level of 103 units and no backlog, which is crucial for maintaining stability in our operations.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maximize our profits.

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

  "inventory": 200,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With a stable inventory and no backlog, I will place an order to maintain supply and avoid stockouts while considering potential demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet expected demand while considering our current inventory of 182 units and a backlog of 0 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to keep our orders aligned with the expected demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and avoid stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production with the expected demand to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to match the recent demand trend while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all maximize our profits.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to meet expected demand.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 103 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 10, 8]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to meet expected demand while considering our current inventory of 182 units and a backlog of 0 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to keep our orders aligned with the expected demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and avoid stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production with the expected demand to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to match the recent demand trend while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is currently at $-921.50, which is concerning. I have 179 units in inventory and no backlog. This means I can meet current demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders to avoid stock-outs. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk oversupply or stock-outs, which could lead to a collapse in our supply chain and further losses for all of us. Therefore, I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products. This will help us minimize holding and backlog costs while maximizing our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.

With 179 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet current demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders to prevent potential losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maintain profitability for all, while being mindful of the risks of stock-outs and oversupply that could lead to a collapse in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities and demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 179 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $-921.50.

Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the importance of coordinating our strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Given my current profit of $-642.00 and my inventory of 90 units with no backlog, I recognize that our decisions directly impact each other's profitability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow of products and minimize costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding the risks of market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess stock.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 179 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 179 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-921.50. With 179 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet current demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders to prevent potential losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maintain profitability for all.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 179 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-921.50. With 179 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet current demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders to prevent potential losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maintain profitability for all.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 90 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our strategies to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-921.50. With 179 units in inventory and no backlog, I can meet current demand, but I need to be cautious about future orders to prevent potential losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and maintain profitability for all.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is $-994.00, and I have 180 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation is critical as stock-outs could lead to lost sales and increased backlog costs. We need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. If we all align our orders based on true demand, we can maximize our profits together.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and avoid the bullwhip effect. This way, we can maintain a steady flow of products and minimize costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 180 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders without immediate risk of stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they want to coordinate orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which is critical for our supply chain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders based on recent demand trends to maximize our profits and prevent any disruptions. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand of 8, 13, and 7 units to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid destabilizing the supply chain, especially since my current profit is $-994.00 and I have 180 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits together.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 180, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 7, Profit: 17.50, Total Profit: -994.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.9, rationale=To meet expected demand and avoid stock-outs, I will order 10 units, covering the recent average demand., risk_assessment=Risk of underestimating demand could lead to stock-outs, but current inventory allows for a buffer., expected_demand_next_round=10, llm_inventory=180, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8, 13, 7], llm_incoming=[7], llm_last_order=10
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-994.00) and how decisions affect it

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which is critical for our supply chain stability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect true demand to prevent any disruptions. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits while avoiding the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand of 8, 13, and 7 units to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which is critical for our supply chain stability. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current profit of $-666.00 is at risk due to potential stock-outs or oversupply. My inventory is at 83 units with no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but also means I need to be cautious about overproduction.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which is critical for our supply chain stability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect true demand to prevent any disruptions. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our profits while avoiding the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand of 8, 13, and 7 units to ensure we all remain profitable and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which is critical for our supply chain stability. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current profit of $-666.00 is at risk due to potential stock-outs or oversupply. My inventory is at 83 units with no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders but also means I need to be cautious about overproduction. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products while maximizing our profits together.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 13, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs, which is critical for our supply chain stability. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders based on recent demand trends.

        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-666.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (83 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 183 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-1060.50, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration. Based on my current inventory and the recent demand trends, I believe we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. If we don't manage our inventory effectively, we risk a collapse that will hurt all of our profits.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 183 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 7, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-1060.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (183 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 183 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 7, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and ensure we can meet customer needs without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-1060.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (183 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 183 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 7, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for effective coordination. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and ensure we can meet customer needs without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our production and orders effectively to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain and prevent any potential market collapse that could hurt all of our profits. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to align with the recent demand trends while ensuring I can meet customer needs without oversupplying, given my current inventory of 73 units and no backlog.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 73 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 7, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-1128.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (181 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 64 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-687.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (64 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 177 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 177 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 177 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 50 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders and forecasts to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits. My current profit is at $-1182.00, and I have 177 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to fulfill orders without immediate risk of stock-outs, but we must be cautious about future demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products while avoiding excessive inventory and backlog costs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 174 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 14, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and agree on order quantities to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and agree on order quantities to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maximize our profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 174 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 14, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and agree on order quantities to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our forecasts and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid further losses. My current profit is at $-666.00, and I have an inventory of 38 units with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and agree on order quantities to minimize fluctuations and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 38 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 14, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 14
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have an inventory of 175 units and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1294.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to align our efforts and maximize total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 175 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders effectively this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have an inventory of 175 units and no backlog, but my total profit is at $-1294.00. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 175 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders effectively this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and share demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round to ensure we can meet it without excess inventory or backlog, which would further threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a stable inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts for the next round to align our orders and prevent stockouts or oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 25 units and no backlog, as I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This will help us maintain a steady flow and prevent market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 25 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders effectively this round.

Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders and share demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. My current inventory is 175 units with no backlog, allowing me to fulfill orders effectively this round. However, if we do not coordinate, we risk stockouts or excess inventory, which could further threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent market instability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 175 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 175 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and share demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round to ensure we can meet it without excess inventory or backlog, which would further threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts for the next round to align our orders and prevent stockouts or oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 25 units and no backlog, as I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This will help us maintain a steady flow and prevent market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders and share demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. My current inventory is 175 units with no backlog, allowing me to fulfill orders effectively this round. However, if we do not coordinate, we risk stockouts or excess inventory, which could further threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent market instability.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 175 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and share demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round to ensure we can meet it without excess inventory or backlog, which would further threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts for the next round to align our orders and prevent stockouts or oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 25 units and no backlog, as I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This will help us maintain a steady flow and prevent market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders and share demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. My current inventory is 175 units with no backlog, allowing me to fulfill orders effectively this round. However, if we do not coordinate, we risk stockouts or excess inventory, which could further threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent market instability.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better coordination to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which is crucial given our current profit situation of $-1294.00. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and share demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand for the next round to ensure we can meet it without excess inventory or backlog, which would further threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts for the next round to align our orders and prevent stockouts or oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and avoid further losses. Therefore, I will produce based on the recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 25 units and no backlog, as I can only ship what is ordered plus my backlog. This will help us maintain a steady flow and prevent market instability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders and share demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain. My current inventory is 175 units with no backlog, allowing me to fulfill orders effectively this round. However, if we do not coordinate, we risk stockouts or excess inventory, which could further threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow and prevent market instability.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My total profit is at $-1345.50, which is concerning. I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog. This situation allows me to meet demand, but I must be cautious about future orders. If we don't coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize the supply chain and hurt all our profits. I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $-1345.50.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 173 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 173 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both expressed concerns about stock-outs and oversupply, emphasizing the need for effective coordination to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and demand forecasts to avoid fluctuations that could harm our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $-1345.50. I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse, which would negatively impact all of us. We need to be cautious about our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream orders plus my backlog. Let's work together to optimize our strategies and keep the supply chain stable.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 173 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both expressed concerns about stock-outs and oversupply, emphasizing the need for effective coordination to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities and demand forecasts to avoid fluctuations that could harm our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 173 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $-1345.50. I propose we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse, which would negatively impact all of us. We need to be cautious about our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream orders plus my backlog. Let's work together to optimize our strategies and keep the supply chain stable.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 11 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($-616.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (11 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 200 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
