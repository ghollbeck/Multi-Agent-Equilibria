--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Orders received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $20.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock to meet demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations and avoid stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. We should share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly.
  Information Shared: I have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, and I will be ordering 10 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are aligned to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Distributor to keep my inventory stable and avoid backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock and avoid the bullwhip effect, which can destabilize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, and I will be ordering 10 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations, and the Wholesaler echoed this by stating they will also order 10 units to keep their inventory stable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned in our approach to maintain sufficient stock levels. However, we must be cautious about the risk of stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while maintaining my inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while ensuring we all stay aligned to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders closely and share our demand forecasts regularly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $20.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this by stating they will also order 10 units to keep their inventory stable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned in our approach to maintain sufficient stock levels. However, I want to emphasize that I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to produce effectively. My profit stands at $20.00, and I am concerned about the risks of stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while ensuring we avoid excess stock and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies closely to prevent stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $20.00.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 10, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 10, Profit: 25.00, Total Profit: 20.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.8, rationale=I need to order 10 units to meet expected demand and maintain a buffer to avoid stock-outs., risk_assessment=If demand exceeds expectations, I risk stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $20.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock to meet demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations and avoid stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's align our ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. We should share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are aligned to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Distributor to keep my inventory stable and avoid backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock and avoid the bullwhip effect, which can destabilize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations, and the Wholesaler echoed this by stating they will also order 10 units to keep their inventory stable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned in our approach to maintain sufficient stock levels. However, we must be cautious about the risk of stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while maintaining my inventory levels.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $20.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock to meet demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations and avoid stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's align our ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable. We should share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are aligned to prevent stock-outs and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Distributor to keep my inventory stable and avoid backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock and avoid the bullwhip effect, which can destabilize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations, and the Wholesaler echoed this by stating they will also order 10 units to keep their inventory stable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned in our approach to maintain sufficient stock levels. However, we must be cautious about the risk of stockouts or oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while maintaining my inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders closely and share our demand forecasts regularly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this by stating they will also order 10 units to keep their inventory stable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned in our approach to maintain sufficient stock levels. However, I want to emphasize that I currently have 10 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to produce effectively. My profit stands at $20.00, and I am concerned about the risks of stockouts or oversupply that could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while ensuring we avoid excess stock and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies closely to prevent stockouts and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipate future demand while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet customer demand. My total profit so far is $37.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to avoid any disruptions. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me in a vulnerable position to meet future demand. I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply. This will help us maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover potential demand while keeping an eye on my inventory and backlog situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, and my total profit so far is $45.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to communicate effectively to maintain a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me in a position where I cannot fulfill any additional demand without placing an order. I propose that we establish a routine for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, as this will help us all maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and minimize the risk of stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to avoid any disruptions. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me in a vulnerable position to meet future demand. I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and minimize risks of stock-outs or oversupply. This will help us maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our inventory levels and order quantities to avoid disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to communicate effectively to maintain a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me in a position where I cannot fulfill any additional demand without placing an order. I propose that we establish a routine for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, as this will help us all maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and minimize risks of stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing the need for alignment in our inventory levels and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to work together to avoid stock-outs and maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory and backlog situations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs.

Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me in a position where I cannot fulfill any additional demand without placing an order. I propose that we establish a routine for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better coordinate our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, as this will help us all maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders and minimize risks of stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing the need for alignment in our inventory levels and order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to work together to avoid stock-outs and maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory and backlog situations.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($45.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units. My profit so far is $50.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be ordering 15 units this round to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipate future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all maintain profitability. If we can share our demand forecasts, we can better manage our inventory levels across the supply chain.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 8 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 15, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units. My profit so far is $50.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be ordering 15 units this round to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's align our ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all maintain profitability. If we can share our demand forecasts, we can better manage our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, highlighting the urgency of our situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and ensure profitability across the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 10 units this round to maintain a buffer while considering the Retailer's backlog.
  Proposal: Let's align our ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all maintain profitability. Sharing our demand forecasts can help manage our inventory levels effectively.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, highlighting the urgency of our situation. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act swiftly to prevent stock-outs that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will order 10 units to meet the Wholesaler's order and prepare for the Retailer's backlog, while also considering the need to maintain a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and potential stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, highlighting the urgency of our situation. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act swiftly to prevent stock-outs that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog of 10 units, while also considering the recent demand of 10 units to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and potential stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units. My profit so far is $50.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be ordering 15 units this round to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's align our ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all maintain profitability. If we can share our demand forecasts, we can better manage our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, highlighting the urgency of our situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs and ensure profitability across the supply chain. Therefore, I will be ordering 10 units this round to maintain a buffer while considering the Retailer's backlog.

- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, highlighting the urgency of our situation. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act swiftly to prevent stock-outs that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will order 10 units to meet the Wholesaler's order and prepare for the Retailer's backlog, while also considering the need to maintain a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and potential stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, highlighting the urgency of our situation. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act swiftly to prevent stock-outs that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog of 10 units, while also considering the recent demand of 10 units to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and potential stock-outs.

  Proposal: Let's align our ordering strategies to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all maintain profitability. Sharing our demand forecasts can help manage our inventory levels effectively.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, highlighting the urgency of our situation. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act swiftly to prevent stock-outs that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will order 10 units to meet the Wholesaler's order and prepare for the Retailer's backlog, while also considering the need to maintain a stable supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and potential stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, highlighting the urgency of our situation. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to coordinate orders carefully to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must act swiftly to prevent stock-outs that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog of 10 units, while also considering the recent demand of 10 units to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and ordering strategies to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which could lead to increased holding costs and potential stock-outs.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current inventory is at 0 units with a backlog of 11 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure that our orders are aligned with actual demand to prevent a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be ordering 15 units this round to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on current backlog and anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: My total profit so far is $59.00, and I currently have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 11 units.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current inventory is at 0 units with a backlog of 11 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure that our orders are aligned with actual demand to prevent a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be ordering 15 units this round to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 10 units to maintain a buffer while considering my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 0 units.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on current inventory and backlog levels to maintain a steady flow and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current inventory is at 0 units and I have no backlog. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to align with the Wholesaler's order and ensure we can meet the Retailer's demand while avoiding excessive inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products, preventing a bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor are coordinating their orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with the expected demand to avoid further backlog and maintain supply chain stability. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the anticipated demand while considering my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which will help maximize our collective profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current inventory is at 0 units with a backlog of 11 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure that our orders are aligned with actual demand to prevent a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be ordering 15 units this round to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 10 units to maintain a buffer while considering my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 0 units.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on current inventory and backlog levels to maintain a steady flow and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current inventory is at 0 units and I have no backlog. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to align with the Wholesaler's order and ensure we can meet the Retailer's demand while avoiding excessive inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products, preventing a bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor are coordinating their orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with the expected demand to avoid further backlog and maintain supply chain stability. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the anticipated demand while considering my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which will help maximize our collective profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current inventory is at 0 units with a backlog of 11 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure that our orders are aligned with actual demand to prevent a bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will be ordering 15 units this round to cover my backlog and prepare for potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 10 units to maintain a buffer while considering my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 0 units.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on current inventory and backlog levels to maintain a steady flow and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they will order 10 units to maintain a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current inventory is at 0 units and I have no backlog. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to align with the Wholesaler's order and ensure we can meet the Retailer's demand while avoiding excessive inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we are all aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products, preventing a bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they are at risk of stock-outs with a backlog of 11 units and will order 15 units this round. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor are coordinating their orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with the expected demand to avoid further backlog and maintain supply chain stability. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the anticipated demand while considering my current backlog of 20 units and zero inventory.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory, which will help maximize our collective profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to my profit of $67.50. If I cannot meet demand, it will affect the entire supply chain. I propose that we coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We should aim to align our order quantities based on observed demand trends to maintain stability and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while considering the lead time.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 11 units in backlog, which is critical for my operations and affects the entire chain's stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to their profit and the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maintain stability and avoid oversupply or stock-outs, we should align our order quantities based on observed demand trends and ensure that we are all aware of our inventory statuses.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover anticipated demand while considering my current inventory situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and maintain profitability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which is critical for my operations and affects the entire chain's stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to their profit and the entire supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the recent demand trend, while emphasizing the importance of sharing our order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog and align with observed demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 10 units in backlog, which affects the entire chain's stability and profitability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to their profit. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Additionally, Distributor stated they have 0 units in inventory and 10 units in backlog, which affects the entire chain's stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and order quantities effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to address my backlog and align with the anticipated demand, while encouraging everyone to share their forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for all.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to my profit of $67.50. If I cannot meet demand, it will affect the entire supply chain. I propose that we coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We should aim to align our order quantities based on observed demand trends to maintain stability and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to their profit and the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maintain stability and avoid oversupply or stock-outs, we should align our order quantities based on observed demand trends and ensure that we are all aware of our inventory statuses.

  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability across the supply chain.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to my profit of $67.50. If I cannot meet demand, it will affect the entire supply chain. I propose that we coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We should aim to align our order quantities based on observed demand trends to maintain stability and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved.

I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the recent demand trend, while emphasizing the importance of sharing our order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to their profit. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Additionally, Distributor stated they have 0 units in inventory and 10 units in backlog, which affects the entire chain's stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and order quantities effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to address my backlog and align with the anticipated demand, while encouraging everyone to share their forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for all.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to my profit of $67.50. If I cannot meet demand, it will affect the entire supply chain. I propose that we coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We should aim to align our order quantities based on observed demand trends to maintain stability and avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to their profit and the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maintain stability and avoid oversupply or stock-outs, we should align our order quantities based on observed demand trends and ensure that we are all aware of our inventory statuses.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and maintain profitability.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to their profit and the entire supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the recent demand trend, while emphasizing the importance of sharing our order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which poses a risk to their profit. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Additionally, Distributor stated they have 0 units in inventory and 10 units in backlog, which affects the entire chain's stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our production and order quantities effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to address my backlog and align with the anticipated demand, while encouraging everyone to share their forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for all.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability across the supply chain.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My inventory is at 0 units and I have a backlog of 11 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could lead to lost sales and affect our overall profits. My total profit so far is $76.00, but this could be threatened if I cannot meet customer demand. To prevent a collapse in our supply chain, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all have sufficient stock to meet demand. I can only ship the amount equal to my backlog plus any orders I receive, so it's crucial we align our ordering strategies to avoid oversupply or stock-outs. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer needs without excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 11 units in backlog, which is critical for our supply chain stability.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will order enough to cover the anticipated demand while considering my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 0 units. This will help us avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My inventory is at 0 units and I have a backlog of 11 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could lead to lost sales and affect our overall profits. My total profit so far is $76.00, but this could be threatened if I cannot meet customer demand. To prevent a collapse in our supply chain, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all have sufficient stock to meet demand. I can only ship the amount equal to my backlog plus any orders I receive, so it's crucial we align our ordering strategies to avoid oversupply or stock-outs. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer needs without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will order enough to cover the anticipated demand while considering my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 0 units. This will help us avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer needs without excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders effectively to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or risking stock-outs. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and anticipated demand, but I urge everyone to consider their inventory and backlog situations carefully to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer needs without excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the need for coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at 10 units and backlog at 0 units. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can meet customer needs without excess inventory or stock-outs.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round, so I want to share my current situation. My inventory is at 0 units and I have a backlog of 11 units. This puts me at risk of stock-outs, which could lead to lost sales and affect our overall profits. My total profit so far is $76.00, but this could be threatened if I cannot meet customer demand. To prevent a collapse in our supply chain, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all have sufficient stock to meet demand. I can only ship the amount equal to my backlog plus any orders I receive, so it's crucial we align our ordering strategies to avoid oversupply or stock-outs. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can meet customer needs without excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent any disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, I will order enough to cover the anticipated demand while considering my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 0 units. This will help us avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products.

I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to coordinate orders effectively to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying or risking stock-outs.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 11 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the need for coordination to prevent disruptions. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at 10 units and backlog at 0 units. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 5. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Total profit so far: $30.00
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 20,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.",
  "risk_assessment": "The main risk is underestimating future demand, which could lead to backlog if production is too low.",
  "d_demand_next_round": 10,
  "order_quantity": 10
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

External demand (Retailer): 9
Orders received per agent: [9, 10, 0, 10]
Shipments received per agent: [10, 0, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure steady supply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. My total profit so far is $86.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our profits. We need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. I can only ship orders equal to my backlog plus any orders received, so we must plan accordingly to avoid oversupply or stock-outs. Let's work together to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and meet expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which affects my ability to meet customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units as well, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maximize our total profits, I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory. We must be cautious of the risks of oversupply and market instability, as these could threaten our profit trajectories. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this concern with the same inventory and backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, while emphasizing the importance of sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to prevent oversupply or stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all expressing concerns about stock-outs due to their current backlogs of 10 units and 0 inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and help mitigate the risk of stock-outs downstream. It's crucial that we all share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a stable supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure steady supply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. My total profit so far is $86.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our profits. We need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. I can only ship orders equal to my backlog plus any orders received, so we must plan accordingly to avoid oversupply or stock-outs. Let's work together to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units as well, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maximize our total profits, I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory. We must be cautious of the risks of oversupply and market instability, as these could threaten our profit trajectories. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this concern with the same inventory and backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, while emphasizing the importance of sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to prevent oversupply or stock-outs. We must be cautious of the risks of market instability, as this could threaten our profit trajectories. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all expressing concerns about stock-outs due to their current backlogs of 10 units and 0 inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and help mitigate the risk of stock-outs downstream. It's crucial that we all share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a stable supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we must plan accordingly to keep our profits maximized and avoid excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, ensuring we align our orders and production effectively.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure steady supply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. My total profit so far is $86.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our profits. We need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. I can only ship orders equal to my backlog plus any orders received, so we must plan accordingly to avoid oversupply or stock-outs. Let's work together to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units as well, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maximize our total profits, I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory. We must be cautious of the risks of oversupply and market instability, as these could threaten our profit trajectories. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this concern with the same inventory and backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, while emphasizing the importance of sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to prevent oversupply or stock-outs. We must be cautious of the risks of market instability, as this could threaten our profit trajectories. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all expressing concerns about stock-outs due to their current backlogs of 10 units and 0 inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and help mitigate the risk of stock-outs downstream. It's crucial that we all share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a stable supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we must plan accordingly to keep our profits maximized and avoid excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, ensuring we align our orders and production effectively.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure steady supply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. My total profit so far is $86.00, and I want to ensure we all maximize our profits. We need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain a steady flow of products. I can only ship orders equal to my backlog plus any orders received, so we must plan accordingly to avoid oversupply or stock-outs. Let's work together to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units as well, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. To maximize our total profits, I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory. We must be cautious of the risks of oversupply and market instability, as these could threaten our profit trajectories. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts them at risk of stock-outs if demand continues at the current rate. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this concern with the same inventory and backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, while emphasizing the importance of sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to prevent oversupply or stock-outs. We must be cautious of the risks of market instability, as this could threaten our profit trajectories. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we need to plan accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all expressing concerns about stock-outs due to their current backlogs of 10 units and 0 inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and help mitigate the risk of stock-outs downstream. It's crucial that we all share our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to avoid the bullwhip effect and maintain a stable supply chain. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so we must plan accordingly to keep our profits maximized and avoid excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, ensuring we align our orders and production effectively.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current inventory status of 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to be high.

Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the Retailer's needs while also considering my own inventory situation, which is currently at 0 units and a backlog of 20 units.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 10 units to meet my backlog and align with the Retailer's demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory and backlog statuses regularly to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $100.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they also have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to be high, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply. I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which means I cannot ship any product downstream this round. To maintain stability, I propose we all align our orders based on real-time demand and share our inventory statuses regularly. This will help us avoid oversupply and market instability, which could lead to a collapse affecting all of our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 10 units to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory and backlog statuses regularly to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $85.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 0 units.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they also have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. The Distributor emphasized the risk of stock-outs if demand continues to be high. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and help stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and orders based on real-time demand to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, with a total profit of $75.00.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will emphasize my current inventory status of 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to be high. I urge everyone to coordinate their orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of oversupply and market instability, as this could lead to a collapse that affects all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to align our orders based on real-time demand to maintain a steady supply and avoid stock-outs across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, emphasizing the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the Retailer's needs while also considering my own inventory situation, which is currently at 0 units and a backlog of 20 units.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory and backlog statuses regularly to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they also have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to be high, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply. I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which means I cannot ship any product downstream this round. To maintain stability, I propose we all align our orders based on real-time demand and share our inventory statuses regularly. This will help us avoid oversupply and market instability, which could lead to a collapse affecting all of our profits.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current inventory status of 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to be high. I urge everyone to coordinate their orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. We must be cautious of oversupply and market instability, as this could lead to a collapse that affects all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to align our orders based on real-time demand to maintain a steady supply and avoid stock-outs across the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, emphasizing the need for effective communication to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply. Therefore, I will order 10 units to cover my backlog and align with the Retailer's needs while also considering my own inventory situation, which is currently at 0 units and a backlog of 20 units.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory and backlog statuses regularly to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they also have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs if demand continues to be high, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply. I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which means I cannot ship any product downstream this round. To maintain stability, I propose we all align our orders based on real-time demand and share our inventory statuses regularly. This will help us avoid oversupply and market instability, which could lead to a collapse affecting all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our inventory and backlog statuses regularly to align our orders and maintain a steady flow of products across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned they also have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. The Distributor emphasized the risk of stock-outs if demand continues to be high. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all at risk of stock-outs, which threatens our profits. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and help stabilize the supply chain.

        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 28 units, which poses a risk to my profit of $54.00. If I cannot meet demand, it will affect all of us. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we are all profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while being mindful of holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations.
  Information Shared: I am currently facing a backlog of 28 units and have no inventory, which could lead to stock-outs if not addressed promptly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they have a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which poses a risk to their profit. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. If we do not align our orders, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt all our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while considering the Retailer's situation to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could impact the entire chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they have a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which poses a risk to their profit. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have a backlog of 10 units and no inventory, indicating a critical supply issue. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order to cover the anticipated demand while being mindful of my own inventory situation, which is currently at 0 units and a backlog of 0 units. This means I can only ship what is ordered plus any backlog, so we must align our orders to avoid oversupply and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to meet the expected demand while considering the backlogs of the Retailer and Wholesaler.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill orders and could impact the entire chain if not addressed promptly.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 28 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 18]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (28 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 28 units, which poses a risk to my profit of $54.00. If I cannot meet demand, it will affect all of us. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we are all profitable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which poses a risk to their profit. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. If we do not align our orders, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which poses a risk to their profit. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have a backlog of 10 units and no inventory, indicating a critical supply issue. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order to cover the anticipated demand while being mindful of my own inventory situation, which is currently at 0 units and a backlog of 0 units. This means I can only ship what is ordered plus any backlog, so we must align our orders to avoid oversupply and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which poses a risk to their profit. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have a backlog of 10 units and no inventory, indicating a critical supply issue. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover my current backlog of 10 units while being mindful of the overall demand in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules to align our efforts and minimize fluctuations, ensuring we all remain profitable.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 28 units, which poses a risk to my profit of $54.00. If I cannot meet demand, it will affect all of us. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we are all profitable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they have a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which poses a risk to their profit. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. If we do not align our orders, we risk stock-outs and oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain and hurt all our profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which poses a risk to their profit. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have a backlog of 10 units and no inventory, indicating a critical supply issue. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order to cover the anticipated demand while being mindful of my own inventory situation, which is currently at 0 units and a backlog of 0 units. This means I can only ship what is ordered plus any backlog, so we must align our orders to avoid oversupply and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize fluctuations, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have a backlog of 28 units and no inventory, which poses a risk to their profit. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned they have a backlog of 10 units and no inventory, indicating a critical supply issue. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover my current backlog of 10 units while being mindful of the overall demand in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules to align our efforts and minimize fluctuations, ensuring we all remain profitable.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 8. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 10, 10]

        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (10 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-4.50. If I cannot fulfill demand, it will impact all of us negatively. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
  Strategy Hint: I will order enough to cover my backlog and anticipated demand while considering the lead time.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which puts pressure on my ability to meet customer demand and affects the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill any orders. We must align our strategies to ensure steady supply chain flow and maximize our total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover anticipated demand while considering the need to maintain a buffer for future fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit of $135.00 is at risk if we cannot stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will order 10 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while considering the Retailer's backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their anticipated demand clearly to avoid further issues.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 39 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 18, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 38
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (39 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-4.50. If I cannot fulfill demand, it will impact all of us negatively. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill any orders. We must align our strategies to ensure steady supply chain flow and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit of $135.00 is at risk if we cannot stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will order 10 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while considering the Retailer's backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their anticipated demand clearly to avoid further issues.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit of $30.00 is at risk if we cannot stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and anticipated demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected needs clearly to avoid further issues.
  Proposal: I propose that we align our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-4.50. If I cannot fulfill demand, it will impact all of us negatively. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill any orders. We must align our strategies to ensure steady supply chain flow and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit of $135.00 is at risk if we cannot stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will order 10 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while considering the Retailer's backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their anticipated demand clearly to avoid further issues.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit of $30.00 is at risk if we cannot stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and anticipated demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected needs clearly to avoid further issues.
  Proposal: I propose that we align our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens my profit trajectory of $-4.50. If I cannot fulfill demand, it will impact all of us negatively. We must coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize that I currently have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill any orders. We must align our strategies to ensure steady supply chain flow and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit of $135.00 is at risk if we cannot stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will order 10 units to the Factory to ensure I can meet the Wholesaler's needs while considering the Retailer's backlog, but I urge everyone to communicate their anticipated demand clearly to avoid further issues.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts, ensuring we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which threatens their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they have 0 units in inventory and no backlog, limiting their ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders effectively to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current profit of $30.00 is at risk if we cannot stabilize our supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the backlog and anticipated demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their expected needs clearly to avoid further issues.
  Proposal: I propose that we align our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
