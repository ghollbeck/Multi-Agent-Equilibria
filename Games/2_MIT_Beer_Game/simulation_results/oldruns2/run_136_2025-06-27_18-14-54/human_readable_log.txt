Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $14.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I have 37 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $14.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
  Information Shared: I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $14.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, highlighting the need for effective order synchronization. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all meet our targets without creating excess inventory or stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $14.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 37 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 37 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $14.00. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. I also heard the Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, highlighting the need for effective order synchronization. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our profits.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply chain flow.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all meet our targets without creating excess inventory or stock-outs.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $31.50 and an inventory of 25 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $31.50 and an inventory of 25 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our total profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure steady supply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities carefully to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will produce to meet the expected demand of 20 units while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $18.50 and an inventory of 36 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 36 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand effectively.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 12, 2]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 12, 2]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [2]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $18.50 and an inventory of 36 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain a steady flow of inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stockouts and maintain a steady flow of orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying, as my current profit of $18.50 is at risk if we do not stabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stockouts and maintain a steady flow of orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order quantities to optimize our inventory levels and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and production schedule to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 23 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 12, 2]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $24.50 and an inventory of 38 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 38 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 2, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 38 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 2, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $24.50 and an inventory of 38 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. My current profit is $24.50, and I have 38 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so we must plan carefully to avoid stockouts or excess inventory that could hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to match the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 38 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 2, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $24.50 and an inventory of 38 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $28.50 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while avoiding stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [2, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [2, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $28.50 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand effectively while maintaining optimal inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for alignment to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, maximizing our total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand effectively while maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will produce based on the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, while keeping in mind my current inventory of 5 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, maximizing our total profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [2, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $28.50 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand effectively while maintaining optimal inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for alignment to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, maximizing our total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand effectively while maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will produce based on the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, while keeping in mind my current inventory of 5 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, maximizing our total profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $28.50 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand effectively while maintaining optimal inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed the need for alignment to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our orders reflect the actual demand while maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, maximizing our total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand effectively while maintaining optimal inventory levels. Therefore, I will produce based on the expected demand of 20 units for the next round, while keeping in mind my current inventory of 5 units and no backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, maximizing our total profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $37.50 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations in inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand while maintaining a buffer. I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we maximize our profits collectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations in inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this by suggesting we align our expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our anticipated demand for the next round to optimize our orders and maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations in inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $37.50 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations in inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill current demand while maintaining a buffer. I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we maximize our profits collectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations in inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this by suggesting we align our expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our anticipated demand for the next round to optimize our orders and maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize fluctuations in inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of not meeting future demand. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we maximize our collective profits while avoiding excessive inventory or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.

Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits while preventing the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet the current backlog while considering future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy based on recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which affects my ability to fulfill downstream orders. My profit so far is $43.50.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 30 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $47.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand without stock-outs. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $47.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable while preventing the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $43.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits while preventing the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy based on recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 15 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (15 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $47.50. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy based on recent demand trends to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits. I currently have 30 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand without stock-outs. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in demand that could threaten my profit of $47.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all remain profitable while preventing the bullwhip effect.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to ensure we meet demand without causing fluctuations. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 15 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $43.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and production schedules to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits while preventing the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint production strategy based on recent demand trends to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid stock-outs.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $60.50 and an inventory of 29 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 29 units, and I have no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand effectively.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $60.50 and an inventory of 29 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 21 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (21 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $60.50 and an inventory of 29 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the expected demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining steady orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will suggest that we align our order quantities based on the expected demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and prevent excessive fluctuations. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and maintain steady orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to prevent stock-outs and ensure profitability for all.
- Factory: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and maximize profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and order strategies to stabilize our supply chain and prevent excessive fluctuations. Therefore, I will produce to meet the current backlog of 21 units while considering the recent demand trends to avoid future stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that reflects our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without oversupplying.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the recent demand of 10, 11, and 4 units. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while keeping an eye on the overall supply chain stability.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $53.00, and I have 35 units in inventory with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Information Shared: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $53.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units to buffer against potential demand while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's needs without oversupplying.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer while coordinating orders to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $63.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will focus on scheduling production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to avoid excess stock and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will schedule production to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the recent demand of 10, 11, and 4 units. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while keeping an eye on the overall supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units to buffer against potential demand while ensuring I can meet the Wholesaler's needs without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will focus on scheduling production to meet the expected demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels to avoid excess stock and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet the recent demand of 10, 11, and 4 units. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer for expected demand while keeping an eye on the overall supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maximize our total profits and prevent any potential market collapse.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to maintain a steady flow of supply and avoid stockouts or excess inventory.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have sufficient stock without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration in our ordering strategies to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current inventory at 0 units and a backlog of 10 units, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 32
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($47.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (10 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have a profit of $72.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand effectively.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [14]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $72.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to prevent disruptions in the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 11 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $92.50. I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on our current inventory levels and expected demand to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current profit of $95.00 is at risk due to my inventory being at 0 units and a backlog of 3 units. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to prevent stockouts and ensure we can all meet demand effectively while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any disruptions.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 11 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 4, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $72.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to prevent disruptions in the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 11 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $92.50. I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on our current inventory levels and expected demand to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current profit of $95.00 is at risk due to my inventory being at 0 units and a backlog of 3 units. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to prevent stockouts and ensure we can all meet demand effectively while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any disruptions.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have a profit of $72.00 and an inventory of 32 units with no backlog. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and prevent disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our strategies to prevent disruptions in the supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 11 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $92.50. I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on our current inventory levels and expected demand to ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding excessive holding or backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current profit of $95.00 is at risk due to my inventory being at 0 units and a backlog of 3 units. Therefore, I will propose that we align our production and ordering strategies to prevent stockouts and ensure we can all meet demand effectively while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any disruptions.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
