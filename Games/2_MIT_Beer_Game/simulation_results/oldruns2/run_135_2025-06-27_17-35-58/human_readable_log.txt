Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between inventory and demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $5.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will focus on fulfilling the Retailer's order while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a balance between fulfilling orders and keeping a safety stock to mitigate risks.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time for orders.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $5.00 so far. I can ship up to 10 units this round based on the Retailer's order.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, especially considering the 1-round lead time for orders. Therefore, I will focus on maintaining a stable supply while being mindful of our inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer for lead time.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, and coordinate to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $5.00 so far. I can ship up to 10 units this round based on the Wholesaler's order.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while maintaining my current inventory of 40 units and zero backlog. This will help us avoid stockouts and keep our supply chain stable.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer while keeping an eye on demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will focus on fulfilling the Retailer's order while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts and ensure stability in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time for orders.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, especially considering the 1-round lead time for orders. Therefore, I will focus on maintaining a stable supply while being mindful of our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, and coordinate to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed the importance of aligning order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while maintaining my current inventory of 40 units and zero backlog. This will help us avoid stockouts and keep our supply chain stable.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we all have enough stock without overcommitting resources, especially considering the 1-round lead time for orders.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my orders to prevent stock-outs and suggest we all share our demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while closely monitoring demand.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my orders to prevent stock-outs and suggest we all share our demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 32 units and no backlog, but I am concerned about potential demand increases that could threaten my profit of $9.00. We should all share our demand forecasts to optimize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders and share forecasts to minimize risks and maximize profits across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet customer demand without risking excess inventory. My current inventory is 32 units with no backlog, and I have made a profit of $9.00 so far. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders and share forecasts to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely coordinate our production and orders to ensure we can meet customer demand without risking excess inventory. My current profit is $9.00, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will schedule production to align with expected demand while being cautious of potential fluctuations that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules to optimize our supply chain efforts and minimize the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 36 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid unnecessary holding and backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on observed demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $6.00, and I have 36 units in inventory with no backlog. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 18
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 36 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid unnecessary holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round to stabilize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 36 units and a backlog of 0 units, but I will order 20 units from the Distributor to ensure I can fulfill the Retailer's needs while avoiding potential stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to meet the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units from the Factory to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's needs while maintaining a buffer for lead time variability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 20 units to meet the expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production with these orders to avoid excess stock and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the anticipated demand of 20 units next round, while keeping an eye on my current inventory of 26 units and zero backlog to ensure we all avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and production schedules to stabilize our inventory levels and maximize our collective profits.

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 36 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round. This will help us all maximize our profits and avoid unnecessary holding and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a strategy to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet the expected demand of 20 units next round to stabilize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 36 units and a backlog of 0 units, but I will order 20 units from the Distributor to ensure I can fulfill the Retailer's needs while avoiding potential stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to meet the Retailer's needs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our order quantities to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units from the Factory to ensure I can fulfill the Wholesaler's needs while maintaining a buffer for lead time variability.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 2. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 26 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 8, 6]

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 29 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $29.00, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 29 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of synchronizing our ordering strategies to reflect true market demand, as my current inventory is 29 units with no backlog, and my profit is $29.00. This situation poses a risk of stockouts if we do not manage our orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely with actual demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our order quantities based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs. My current inventory is 29 units, and I have no backlog, which means I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. We need to be cautious about over-ordering, as it could lead to excess holding costs and affect our profits. Let's work together to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must closely align our production and ordering strategies to reflect actual demand trends. My current profit is $43.00, and I have 11 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our order quantities based on recent demand while being cautious of over-ordering, as it could lead to excess holding costs and affect our profits. We need to ensure that our decisions do not lead to stockouts or market instability, which would hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on synchronized production and ordering strategies that reflect true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 29 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 29 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of synchronizing our ordering strategies to reflect true market demand, as my current inventory is 29 units with no backlog, and my profit is $29.00. This situation poses a risk of stockouts if we do not manage our orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely with actual demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our order quantities based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs. My current inventory is 29 units, and I have no backlog, which means I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. We need to be cautious about over-ordering, as it could lead to excess holding costs and affect our profits. Let's work together to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must closely align our production and ordering strategies to reflect actual demand trends. My current profit is $43.00, and I have 11 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our order quantities based on recent demand while being cautious of over-ordering, as it could lead to excess holding costs and affect our profits. We need to ensure that our decisions do not lead to stockouts or market instability, which would hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on synchronized production and ordering strategies that reflect true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 11 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 29 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of synchronizing our ordering strategies to reflect true market demand, as my current inventory is 29 units with no backlog, and my profit is $29.00. This situation poses a risk of stockouts if we do not manage our orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders closely with actual demand to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our order quantities based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs. My current inventory is 29 units, and I have no backlog, which means I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. We need to be cautious about over-ordering, as it could lead to excess holding costs and affect our profits. Let's work together to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must closely align our production and ordering strategies to reflect actual demand trends. My current profit is $43.00, and I have 11 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our order quantities based on recent demand while being cautious of over-ordering, as it could lead to excess holding costs and affect our profits. We need to ensure that our decisions do not lead to stockouts or market instability, which would hurt all of our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on synchronized production and ordering strategies that reflect true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs across the supply chain.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $41.50, and I have 25 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 25 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to ensure we can meet the expected demand without causing fluctuations. My current profit is $67.50, but with only 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and our current inventory levels to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any potential collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on expected demand while keeping a close eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits for all.
  Information Shared: I currently have 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, which puts me in a vulnerable position if demand spikes. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $41.50, and I have 25 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet future demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 25 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and our current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet future demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to ensure we can meet the expected demand without causing fluctuations. My current profit is $67.50, but with only 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and our current inventory levels to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any potential collapse.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 25 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 15, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $41.50, and I have 25 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet future demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 25 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and our current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet future demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to ensure we can meet the expected demand without causing fluctuations. My current profit is $67.50, but with only 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and our current inventory levels to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any potential collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits for all.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 1 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 15, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. My current profit is $41.50, and I have 25 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without causing fluctuations. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and stabilize the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet future demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our profits. I currently have 25 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and our current inventory levels to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet future demand without causing fluctuations.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and order quantities closely to ensure we can meet the expected demand without causing fluctuations. My current profit is $67.50, but with only 1 unit in inventory and no backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and our current inventory levels to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent any potential collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that considers our current inventory levels and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits for all.

Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 32 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to meet the anticipated demand without oversupplying.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $45.50, and I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, which is currently 0.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet anticipated demand while avoiding oversupply. Therefore, I will focus on maintaining a steady inventory level and suggest we share our demand forecasts more effectively.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [1]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 7 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (7 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 32 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our order quantities to meet the anticipated demand without oversupplying.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet anticipated demand while avoiding oversupply. Therefore, I will focus on maintaining a steady inventory level and suggest we share our demand forecasts more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to meet anticipated demand while avoiding oversupply. My current profit is $45.50, and I have 32 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts more effectively and agree on order quantities that stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can threaten our profit margins and lead to market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to ensure steady supply and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules to meet anticipated demand while avoiding oversupply. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill downstream orders. Therefore, I will schedule production to address my backlog while considering the recent demand trends to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a shared understanding of demand forecasts and production schedules to ensure steady supply and prevent the bullwhip effect.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $51.50, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities closely to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, especially since I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. My current profit is $51.50, and I want to ensure that we all maximize our profits while avoiding any potential market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential increases.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units puts me at risk of not meeting demand, which could lead to further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet the expected demand without creating excess stock or further backlogs. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits, especially since my current profit is $35.50 and I need to manage my backlog costs effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the expected demand while keeping an eye on backlog levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units, which affects my ability to meet downstream demand this round.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 33 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $51.50, and I have 33 units in inventory with no backlog. This situation allows me to meet current demand, but I am concerned about potential stock-outs if demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid oversupply and stock-outs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities closely to ensure we can meet demand without risking excess inventory or backlogs. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, especially since I currently have 33 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand this round. My current profit is $51.50, and I want to ensure that we all maximize our profits while avoiding any potential market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units puts me at risk of not meeting demand, which could lead to further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet the expected demand without creating excess stock or further backlogs. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits, especially since my current profit is $35.50 and I need to manage my backlog costs effectively.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maintain a steady flow of products and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels and coordinating our orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 16 units puts me at risk of not meeting demand, which could lead to further losses. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet the expected demand without creating excess stock or further backlogs. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits, especially since my current profit is $35.50 and I need to manage my backlog costs effectively.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 16 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (16 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $52.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer in my inventory while fulfilling orders to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to order based on the average of recent demand trends to keep our inventory levels steady and maximize our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to order based on the average of recent demand trends to keep our inventory levels steady and maximize our profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to order based on the average of recent demand trends to keep our inventory levels steady and maximize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources. My current profit is $29.00, but with a backlog of 16 units and no inventory, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively. We need to be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid costly excess stock or shortages.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our production and ordering based on recent demand trends to keep our inventory levels steady and maximize our profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 9, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on the recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities based on recent demand patterns to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to order based on the average of recent demand trends to keep our inventory levels steady and maximize our profits.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for coordination to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources. My current profit is $29.00, but with a backlog of 16 units and no inventory, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively. We need to be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid costly excess stock or shortages.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our production and ordering based on recent demand trends to keep our inventory levels steady and maximize our profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production and ordering strategies to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure we all meet customer demand without overcommitting resources. My current profit is $29.00, but with a backlog of 16 units and no inventory, I am at risk of stockouts if we do not coordinate effectively. We need to be mindful of our shipment constraints, as I can only ship the amount equal to the downstream order plus my backlog. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid costly excess stock or shortages.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 35 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our inventory and backlog statuses to optimize our collective ordering strategy.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and aligning our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 19 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting the importance of synchronized ordering to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs. We need to be cautious of stock-outs, as my current profit of $66.00 could be threatened if we do not manage our orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must closely coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $57.00. Therefore, I will focus on producing to meet the expected demand while ensuring we all align our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess stock across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 19 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 35 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.

  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and aligning our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 19 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting the importance of synchronized ordering to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs. We need to be cautious of stock-outs, as my current profit of $66.00 could be threatened if we do not manage our orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must closely coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $57.00. Therefore, I will focus on producing to meet the expected demand while ensuring we all align our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess stock across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 8 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 7, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 24
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 35 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of coordinating our orders to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and aligning orders with actual demand to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our inventory and backlog statuses to optimize our collective ordering strategy.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and aligning our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders closely to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 19 units and a backlog of 0 units, highlighting the importance of synchronized ordering to maximize our collective profits and minimize costs. We need to be cautious of stock-outs, as my current profit of $66.00 could be threatened if we do not manage our orders effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the need for better demand forecasting and synchronized ordering to avoid stock-outs and excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must closely coordinate our production and ordering strategies to maintain a steady flow and prevent the bullwhip effect. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 8 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $57.00. Therefore, I will focus on producing to meet the expected demand while ensuring we all align our orders to avoid stock-outs and excess stock across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a synchronized ordering strategy that reflects true market demand, ensuring we all maximize our profits and minimize costs.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $57.50, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders to avoid stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer for lead time.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on joint order quantities that reflect our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 18 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand but requires careful planning for future orders to avoid stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid disruptions. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on expected demand while ensuring we avoid excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on joint production and order quantities that reflect our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which means I can only ship what is ordered plus any backlog. This requires careful planning to ensure we all remain profitable.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $57.50, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 18 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $57.50, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on joint order quantities that reflect our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid disruptions. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree on joint production and order quantities that reflect our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent stock-outs.

1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 8, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 16
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. My current profit is $57.50, and I have 34 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining a steady flow of orders to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities based on recent demand trends and share our forecasts to optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities that reflects our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities based on recent demand trends to maintain a stable supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's agree on joint order quantities that reflect our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our production schedules with the expected demand to maintain a steady flow and avoid disruptions. Therefore, I will produce 20 units this round to meet the anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our collective inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree on joint production and order quantities that reflect our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize total supply chain profits and prevent stock-outs.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.
