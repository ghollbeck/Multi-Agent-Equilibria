--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand next round. This aligns with my own observations of recent order patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for a higher order quantity to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will be placing an order for 20 units to cover anticipated demand and maintain my inventory buffer.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on balancing inventory levels while meeting expected demand to minimize backlog costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand forecasts so that we can adjust our orders accordingly and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 101 units with recent demand at 9 units, and I anticipate demand to increase to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand and their plan to order 20 units to maintain their inventory buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for higher demand and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units to align with the anticipated demand while still maintaining a buffer in case of fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: My focus is on maintaining stability while preparing for increased demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 101, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=To meet anticipated demand and maintain a buffer, I will order 20 units., risk_assessment=Risks include overordering leading to excess holding costs or underordering causing unmet demand., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=101, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9], llm_incoming=[9], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for real-time updates on our demand forecasts and order plans to enhance our coordination.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a plan to place an order for 20 units to cover anticipated demand while keeping a buffer. Additionally, the Distributor and Factory echoed similar sentiments regarding aligning orders to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned on the expectation of increased demand, and it is crucial for us to coordinate effectively. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units to ensure I meet the expected demand while maintaining my inventory stability.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel for sharing our demand forecasts and order plans to better synchronize efforts and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned placing an order for 20 units to cover their anticipated demand while keeping a buffer. The Wholesaler also emphasized the importance of coordinating orders to prevent stockouts and plans to order 30 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned on the expectation of increased demand, but we should be cautious of maintaining our inventory levels without excess. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to balance my inventory while being responsive to the anticipated demand increase.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With current inventory and no backlog, a balanced approach to ordering can mitigate risks of stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
