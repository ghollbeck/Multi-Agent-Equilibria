--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that recent demand has been lower than expected, with only 12 units ordered last round. This trend may indicate a potential shift in consumer behavior. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should remain cautious about overreacting to demand signals. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels while planning for an increased order quantity to meet the expected demand in the next round.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to manage my inventory carefully to avoid stockouts while responding to demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure better alignment and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 98 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round. I believe this information can aid in our collective planning.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that recent demand has been lower than expected and that they plan to maintain inventory levels while preparing for increased orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain cautious to avoid excess inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy while anticipating demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will keep my inventory stable while aligning my orders based on collective forecasts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and demand expectations to enhance our planning and reduce risks of stockouts or overstock.
  Information Shared: I currently have 98 units in inventory and expect a demand of 80 units next round, which reflects my proactive strategy.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that recent demand has been lower than expected and they plan to maintain inventory levels while preparing for increased orders. Additionally, the Wholesaler mentioned their intention to keep inventory stable while aligning orders based on collective forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious of demand fluctuations to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory and place an order of 50 units to ensure we can meet the expected demand next round while keeping a buffer to address possible surges.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to keep a balance between inventory stability and responding to potential demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we establish regular updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to improve our overall alignment and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 98 units in inventory and expect demand of 50 units next round, which reflects my proactive strategy.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer mentioned that recent demand has been lower than expected, and Wholesaler emphasized maintaining current order strategies to avoid excess inventory. Additionally, Distributor noted the need for caution regarding demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our approaches to mitigate risks associated with demand changes. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with anticipated demand while monitoring inventory levels closely.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance responsiveness to demand while minimizing excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we have a shared platform to regularly update our inventory levels and demand forecasts, aiding in better collective decision-making.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 98 units in inventory and anticipate a demand of 20 units next round, which supports a stable approach.
  Confidence: 0.8

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 106, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 12, Profit: 60.00, Total Profit: 18.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=Need to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer to prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, leading to potential overstock or stockouts., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=98, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[12], llm_incoming=[12], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "rationale": "Current inventory is sufficient to meet expected demand while avoiding backlog costs.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential for fluctuating demand may lead to overstock or stockouts.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents in this round. However, I want to highlight that our recent demand has been 12 units and I'm anticipating an increase to 20 units next round. This suggests that we need to be cautious of overstocking but also prepare for growing demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with expected demand and avoid potential stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer mentioned the need to reduce backlog and coordinate on demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing demand insights could help stabilize our inventory levels and minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose we collectively analyze demand patterns to better align our orders.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory updates to better synchronize our supply chain efforts.
- Distributor: I currently have 98 units in inventory and have observed a recent demand of 12 units. I am prepared for potential demand fluctuations and expect a higher demand next round. Collaboration in forecasting could optimize our order quantities and inventory levels.
  Proposal: I suggest we all share our expected demand for the upcoming rounds to align our orders and minimize stockouts.
- Factory: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. This aligns with my own observations of recent demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our inventory levels and communicate our order quantities to better anticipate spikes. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy while encouraging open dialogue on upcoming demand forecasts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our respective forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our ordering strategies and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents in this round. However, I want to highlight that our recent demand has been 12 units and I'm anticipating an increase to 20 units next round. This suggests that we need to be cautious of overstocking but also prepare for growing demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with expected demand and avoid potential stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer mentioned the need to reduce backlog and coordinate on demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing demand insights could help stabilize our inventory levels and minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose we collectively analyze demand patterns to better align our orders.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory updates to better synchronize our supply chain efforts.
- Distributor: I currently have 98 units in inventory and have observed a recent demand of 12 units. I am prepared for potential demand fluctuations and expect a higher demand next round. Collaboration in forecasting could optimize our order quantities and inventory levels.
  Proposal: I suggest we all share our expected demand for the upcoming rounds to align our orders and minimize stockouts.
- Factory: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. This aligns with my own observations of recent demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our inventory levels and communicate our order quantities to better anticipate spikes. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy while encouraging open dialogue on upcoming demand forecasts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our respective forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our ordering strategies and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 2 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed fluctuating demand with recent orders at 12 and 7 units. I understand that maintaining a balance between inventory and demand is crucial. Therefore, I suggest sharing our demand forecasts regularly to optimize our ordering process and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a steady order quantity while monitoring demand closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share weekly updates on our respective inventory levels and demand forecasts to better align our orders.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory stands at 109 units with no backlog, and I expect a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they observed fluctuating demand with recent orders at 12 and 7 units and proposed sharing demand forecasts to optimize ordering. Based on this, my conclusion is that collaboration is essential to mitigate the effects of demand variability. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 80 units for the next round to ensure I am prepared for the anticipated demand while also recommending that we all coordinate closely to align our orders and inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to keep a steady order of 80 units while closely monitoring demand patterns.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a bi-weekly communication schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, enhancing alignment across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory stands at 81 units with no backlog, and I am anticipating a demand of 80 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they observed fluctuating demand with recent orders at 12 and 7 units and proposed sharing demand forecasts to optimize ordering. I also hear Wholesaler concluding that collaboration is essential and plans to maintain an order quantity at 80 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that our collective awareness of demand variability and the need for coordination is crucial for all of us. Therefore, I will suggest we establish a unified approach to share demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders, which can mitigate potential backlog and enhance our profit margins.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a proactive inventory strategy while encouraging collaborative demand forecasting.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's implement a weekly communication schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, enhancing alignment across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory stands at 61 units, and I expect a demand of 50 units next round, with a recent total profit of $266.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they observe fluctuating demand and suggested sharing demand forecasts, while Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration and plans to maintain a steady order. Distributor also noted the necessity of a unified approach for sharing forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that effective communication is essential to manage our orders and inventory efficiently. Therefore, I will propose that we establish a consistent schedule for sharing inventory levels and demand forecasts, which can help us all align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain my order level while ensuring we have clear communication about demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly communication schedule for sharing inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance coordination across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 41 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round, with no backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 122, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 7, Profit: 35.00, Total Profit: -27.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=Maintaining a buffer to cover expected demand and avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could lead to overstock; coordination is essential., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=109, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[12, 7], llm_incoming=[27], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 109 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [27]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 7.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 12 and 7 units, indicating variability. I believe we should closely monitor demand trends to align our orders and reduce excess inventory. I hear that coordination among us could help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels more often. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to maintain a buffer while being attentive to market changes.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update on demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer is experiencing fluctuating demand and is concerned about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to stabilize inventory across the chain. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order that aligns with the expected demand, but I urge all of us to share our forecasts moving forward to prevent any backlog issues.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand figures for the upcoming rounds to align our orders more effectively.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer has expressed concerns about fluctuations in demand and the need for timely orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to better align with observed demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to ensure we are prepared for the expected surge in demand while preventing backlog issues.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our upcoming order quantities and anticipated demands to minimize the bullwhip effect across the chain.
- Factory: I don't have previous messages to reflect on, but I want to share that I have observed a recent spike in demand, with orders totaling 47 units. This is higher than our previous average. Maintaining open communication on demand forecasts will help us all mitigate the bullwhip effect. I encourage everyone to share their upcoming demand estimates so we can align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our strategies.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 12 and 7 units, indicating variability. I believe we should closely monitor demand trends to align our orders and reduce excess inventory. I hear that coordination among us could help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels more often. Therefore, I will continue to order 20 units to maintain a buffer while being attentive to market changes.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update on demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer is experiencing fluctuating demand and is concerned about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to stabilize inventory across the chain. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory strategy while placing an order that aligns with the expected demand, but I urge all of us to share our forecasts moving forward to prevent any backlog issues.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand figures for the upcoming rounds to align our orders more effectively.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer has expressed concerns about fluctuations in demand and the need for timely orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to better align with observed demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to ensure we are prepared for the expected surge in demand while preventing backlog issues.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our upcoming order quantities and anticipated demands to minimize the bullwhip effect across the chain.
- Factory: I don't have previous messages to reflect on, but I want to share that I have observed a recent spike in demand, with orders totaling 47 units. This is higher than our previous average. Maintaining open communication on demand forecasts will help us all mitigate the bullwhip effect. I encourage everyone to share their upcoming demand estimates so we can align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our strategies.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [12, 12, 12, 32]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that other agents are concerned about demand fluctuations. It seems essential for all of us to align our orders to manage inventory levels effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing demand forecasts could help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand patterns closely and adjust my orders accordingly.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining sufficient inventory while remaining responsive to demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our recent order trends and any demand forecasts to better align our inventory management strategies.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory stands at 125 units, and I've observed recent demand orders of 12, 7, and 9. This suggests a stabilization in demand, which could inform our collective strategies.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned that sharing demand forecasts could help mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that collaboration and transparency can enhance our inventory management strategies. Therefore, I will share my recent demand observations and suggest we align our orders to better handle fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on information sharing to stabilize our supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we create a shared document where we can update our demand forecasts and order trends regularly.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory is at 74 units with recent demand orders averaging around 9 units. I anticipate a demand of 80 units next round, which suggests we should be proactive in our ordering strategies.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that sharing demand forecasts could help mitigate the bullwhip effect. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of collaboration and transparency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should leverage our recent demand observations to align our orders and stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose we establish a shared document to regularly update our demand forecasts and order patterns, enabling us to respond more effectively to fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders based on shared demand insights to reduce volatility.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's create a shared document for updating our demand forecasts and order trends regularly.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory is at 25 units, and I am expecting a demand of 50 units next round, indicating a potential need for proactive coordination.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer mentioned the importance of aligning our orders to manage inventory levels effectively and proposed sharing demand forecasts. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize collaboration and transparency. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should actively share our current inventory levels and demand forecasts to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that my inventory is currently at 0 units with a backlog of 66 units. I anticipate a demand of 20 units next round, but I am concerned about the high backlog. I encourage everyone to update our shared document regularly to align on our orders and better manage fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on transparency and proactive coordination to manage demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular update system for our shared demand forecasts and order trends to enhance our supply chain stability.
  Information Shared: I currently have a backlog of 66 units and no inventory, anticipating a demand of 20 units next round.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 125 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -26.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that effective communication and demand forecasting are crucial for reducing stockouts and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that close collaboration on expected demand patterns will help us all manage our inventories better. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units while staying alert to any updates on demand from the Wholesaler and Distributor.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts to align our ordering strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is we should all align our orders according to anticipated demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 80 units to maintain inventory while preparing for expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more transparently to better align our order quantities and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I haven't received any messages yet, but I want to proactively share my observations on recent demand patterns. The last three orders have shown a significant increase, with demands of 12, 27, and 29 units. This indicates a potential upward trend that could lead to further demand surges. I suggest we align our orders to better manage our inventories and avoid stockouts. This will help mitigate the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear that there is significant demand from the Retailer and Distributor, with orders totaling 118 units recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders better to manage the backlog effectively across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to help mitigate my backlog while also encouraging others to assess their capacities and adjust their orders accordingly.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our forecasts and order patterns regularly to align our actions and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that effective communication and demand forecasting are crucial for reducing stockouts and overstocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that close collaboration on expected demand patterns will help us all manage our inventories better. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units while staying alert to any updates on demand from the Wholesaler and Distributor.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts to align our ordering strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that maintaining stable inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is we should all align our orders according to anticipated demand trends. Therefore, I will place an order of 80 units to maintain inventory while preparing for expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more transparently to better align our order quantities and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I haven't received any messages yet, but I want to proactively share my observations on recent demand patterns. The last three orders have shown a significant increase, with demands of 12, 27, and 29 units. This indicates a potential upward trend that could lead to further demand surges. I suggest we align our orders to better manage our inventories and avoid stockouts. This will help mitigate the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear that there is significant demand from the Retailer and Distributor, with orders totaling 118 units recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders better to manage the backlog effectively across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to help mitigate my backlog while also encouraging others to assess their capacities and adjust their orders accordingly.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our forecasts and order patterns regularly to align our actions and reduce the bullwhip effect.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 66 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 47, 59]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [125]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 244.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (66 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 4 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 14
Shipments received per agent: [27, 47, 67, 67]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand fluctuation with orders increasing from 7 to 14 units in the last few rounds. I hear that the wholesalers and distributors may also be adjusting their inventory levels based on these trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that there may be potential for overstock or stockouts if we don't align our orders. Therefore, I will maintain my current order level of 20 units to cushion against the fluctuating demand while ensuring I have sufficient inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to align my orders with anticipated demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we coordinate our order quantities based on shared insights about demand trends to minimize the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 149 units, which is above my usual target, and I am anticipating an expected demand of 20 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a recent demand fluctuation, noting the increase in orders from 7 to 14 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that the overall demand is likely trending upward, which could create stockouts if not managed carefully across our supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level of 92 units and place an order of 80 units to align with the anticipated demand while preventing potential shortages.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet increasing demand while minimizing backlog risk.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand figures regularly so we can align our orders and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: My current inventory stands at 92 units, with an expected demand of 80 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer mentioned a recent demand fluctuation and their intention to maintain a buffer with their order level. I also hear Wholesaler noting the upward trend in demand and their plan to place an order of 80 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor the demand spikes to avoid stockouts while also considering the risk of overstock. Therefore, I will keep my order quantity at 50 units to maintain a balance between supply and demand while managing my current inventory of 3 units.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to stabilize my inventory while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand figures regularly to better align our orders and inventory levels, reducing the risk of stockouts.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 3 units, and I anticipate a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they are maintaining their order level at 20 units to cushion against fluctuating demand, and Wholesaler mentioned placing an order of 80 units to align with anticipated demand trends. Distributor also shared they will keep their order quantity at 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a general awareness of demand fluctuations and a need to prevent stockouts. However, with my current backlog of 33 units and zero inventory, I must prioritize fulfilling these backorders while considering future demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to closely monitor backlog levels while managing order quantities to meet upcoming demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share real-time inventory and expected demand updates regularly to better align our orders and avoid potential stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 33 units and anticipate a demand of 20 units for the next round.

          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -23.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demands increasing with orders of 7, 9, and 14 units. This trend indicates a potential rise in demand. I encourage everyone to communicate their inventory levels and projected demands to better align our orders and avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Collaboration is key to reducing the bullwhip effect and maximizing profits for all parties involved.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will help us make more informed order decisions.
- Wholesaler: I have observed the recent demand patterns trending upward with recent orders of 7, 9, and 14. This indicates a possible increase in consumer demand. I hear that the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to enhance our communication and forecasting to avoid any stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for anticipated demand while suggesting that others also consider adjusting their orders to align with this trend.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular update mechanism for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand orders averaging around 30 units, indicating a potential upward trend. I suggest we coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure we are responsive to actual demand. I currently have 3 units in inventory with a last order of 50, which may not sufficiently cover the expected demand next round. Therefore, I encourage others to share their inventory levels and demand forecasts.
  Proposal: Let’s agree to share demand forecasts weekly to align our order quantities and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have noticed the recent demand spikes with orders of 47, 59, and 64 units which indicate increased consumer interest. I also understand that we have a backlog of 33 units, signaling a need for immediate action to fulfill these orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that collaboration among us is crucial to meet demand while reducing excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 80 units to ensure we can satisfy the backlog and prepare for potential future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demands increasing with orders of 7, 9, and 14 units. This trend indicates a potential rise in demand. I encourage everyone to communicate their inventory levels and projected demands to better align our orders and avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Collaboration is key to reducing the bullwhip effect and maximizing profits for all parties involved.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will help us make more informed order decisions.
- Wholesaler: I have observed the recent demand patterns trending upward with recent orders of 7, 9, and 14. This indicates a possible increase in consumer demand. I hear that the Retailer mentioned concerns about stock levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to enhance our communication and forecasting to avoid any stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for anticipated demand while suggesting that others also consider adjusting their orders to align with this trend.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular update mechanism for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand orders averaging around 30 units, indicating a potential upward trend. I suggest we coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure we are responsive to actual demand. I currently have 3 units in inventory with a last order of 50, which may not sufficiently cover the expected demand next round. Therefore, I encourage others to share their inventory levels and demand forecasts.
  Proposal: Let’s agree to share demand forecasts weekly to align our order quantities and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have noticed the recent demand spikes with orders of 47, 59, and 64 units which indicate increased consumer interest. I also understand that we have a backlog of 33 units, signaling a need for immediate action to fulfill these orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that collaboration among us is crucial to meet demand while reducing excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 80 units to ensure we can satisfy the backlog and prepare for potential future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 33 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [47, 59, 64]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [97]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 80
          - Last round profit: 219.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (33 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
