🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: []
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None
          - Current bank balance: $200.00
          - Profit history (last 0 rounds): []
          - Balance history (last 0 rounds): []

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

🎮 ROUND 1/10 - External Demand: 11 🎮
🎲============================================================================🎲

💬 COMMUNICATION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 0. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10]
          - Last order placed: None

          - Total profit so far: $250.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [50.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$250.00']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 0. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10]
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 50.0
          - Total profit so far: $250.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [50.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$250.00']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 1 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 50.0
          - Current bank balance: $250.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [50.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$250.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 1 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 45.0
          - Current bank balance: $245.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [45.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$245.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 1 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 50.0
          - Current bank balance: $250.00
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [50.0]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$250.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game, Round 1. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 0]
          - Last order placed: 18
          - Last round profit: 0.0
          - Total profit so far: $205.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [50.0, 0.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$250.00', '$205.00']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 1. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 0]
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 0.0
          - Total profit so far: $220.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [50.0, 0.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$250.00', '$220.00']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

🎯 DECISION PHASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 11 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: 0.0
          - Current bank balance: $212.50
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [50.0, 0.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$250.00', '$212.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 11 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 18
          - Last round profit: 0.0
          - Current bank balance: $205.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [50.0, 0.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$250.00', '$205.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

        Current Strategy:

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 11 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 0.0
          - Current bank balance: $220.00
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [50.0, 0.0]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$250.00', '$220.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Retailer (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Distributor (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game, Round 2. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 13 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [11, 10, 12]
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: -15.0
          - Total profit so far: $112.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [45.0, -55.0, -15.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$245.00', '$160.00', '$112.50']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game, Round 2. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: 50.0
          - Total profit so far: $222.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [50.0, 0.0, 50.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$250.00', '$205.00', '$222.50']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($150.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (10 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

🎯 DECISION PHASE

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 23 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: 50.0
          - Current bank balance: $230.00
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [50.0, 0.0, 50.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$250.00', '$212.50', '$230.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 23 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 13 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: -15.0
          - Current bank balance: $112.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [45.0, -55.0, -15.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$245.00', '$160.00', '$112.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (13 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: 50.0
          - Current bank balance: $222.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [50.0, 0.0, 50.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$250.00', '$205.00', '$222.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 3. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 0, 10, 0]
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: 0.0
          - Total profit so far: $192.50
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [50.0, 0.0, 50.0, 0.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$250.00', '$212.50', '$230.00', '$192.50']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

🤖 LLM COMMUNICATION CALL - Factory (Round 3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.


👤 User Prompt:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 3. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 0, 10, 0]
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: -50.0
          - Total profit so far: $78.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [50.0, 0.0, -50.0, -50.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$250.00', '$220.00', '$150.50', '$78.00']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        💀 **BALANCE SURVIVAL**: Your bank balance is your lifeline - if it reaches $0, you bankrupt and the simulation ends. Every order costs money immediately, every unit held costs money per round. Monitor spending carefully!
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        🎯 **STRATEGIC PLANNING**: Consider long-term demand trends and build inventory to serve multiple future rounds, not just immediate needs.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Retailer (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 36 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 26 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 12, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: -130.0
          - Current bank balance: $-55.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [45.0, -55.0, -15.0, -130.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$245.00', '$160.00', '$112.50', '$-55.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (26 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Wholesaler (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 0 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 36 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: 0.0
          - Current bank balance: $192.50
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [50.0, 0.0, 50.0, 0.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$250.00', '$212.50', '$230.00', '$192.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.1 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $5.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Distributor (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 💀 **BALANCE IS YOUR LIFELINE**: Your bank balance is the most critical survival metric. Every order you place costs money immediately (purchase/production cost), and every unit you hold costs money per round (holding cost). If your balance reaches $0 or below, you go bankrupt and the entire simulation ends. Monitor your spending carefully and always ensure you have enough funds to cover your costs.
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
        - 🎯 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: Think beyond just the next round. Consider trends in demand patterns, seasonal variations, and build inventory strategically to serve multiple future rounds. Don't just react to immediate needs - plan ahead to ensure you can consistently meet demand while managing costs effectively.

🤖 LLM DECISION CALL - Factory (Round 0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔧 System Prompt:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. Communication is disabled in the current simulation run.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

**IMPORTANT PROFITABILITY NOTE:** If your profits are negative or consistently low, you should consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.

**ORDERING OPTIONS:** You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.
